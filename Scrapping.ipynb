      "Machine learning has emerged with big data technologies and high-performance computing to create new opportunities for data intensive science in the multi-disciplinary agri-technologies domain. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications of machine learning in agricultural production systems. The works analyzed were categorized in (a) crop management, including applications on yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection crop quality, and species recognition; (b) livestock management, including applications on animal welfare and livestock production; (c) water management; and (d) soil management. The filtering and classification of the presented articles demonstrate how agriculture will benefit from machine learning technologies. By applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems are evolving into real time artificial intelligence enabled programs that provide rich recommendations and insights for farmer decision support and action.\n",

      "Climate, groundwater extraction, and surface water flows have complex nonlinear relationships with groundwater level in agricultural regions. To better understand the relative importance of each driver and predict groundwater level change, we develop a new ensemble modeling framework based on spectral analysis, machine learning, and uncertainty analysis, as an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models. We apply and evaluate this new approach in the context of two aquifer systems supporting agricultural production in the United States: the High Plains aquifer (HPA) and the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer (MRVA). We select input data sets by using a combination of mutual information, genetic algorithms, and lag analysis, and then use the selected data sets in a Multilayer Perceptron network architecture to simulate seasonal groundwater level change. As expected, model results suggest that irrigation demand has the highest influence on groundwater level change for a majority of the wells. The subset of groundwater observations not used in model training or cross‐validation correlates strongly (R > 0.8) with model results for 88 and 83% of the wells in the HPA and MRVA, respectively. In both aquifer systems, the error in the modeled cumulative groundwater level change during testing (2003–2012) was less than 2 m over a majority of the area. We conclude that our modeling framework can serve as an alternative approach to simulating groundwater level change and water availability, especially in regions where subsurface properties are unknown.\n",

      "For the case where treatment is assigned based on a complex or non-linear combination of observables, ML may help flexibly model selection. DML combines the predictive power of ML with an approach to address regularisation bias (Belloni et al., 2016; Chernozhukov et al., 2017, 2018a). Consider the following model where the outcome of interest is the additive effect of treatment plus some non-linear function of covariates (1), and those same covariates non-linearly determine treatment (2):  Y=Dθ0+g0(X)+U;E[U|D,X]=0(1) D=m0(X)+V;E[V|X]=0(2)where Y is the outcome variable, D the treatment, θ0 the marginal treatment effect, and g0 and m0 are functions depending on controls, X. The error terms U and V are mean zero conditional on the respective right-hand side variables. A large dimension of X combined with a complex g0(X) complicates the estimation of g0(X) with standard econometric estimators, suggesting the employment of flexible ML tools such as lasso, random forests or NN. However, the regularisation bias inherent in such tools would render a naive application and subsequent estimation of θ0 biased. The idea behind DML is to offset the regularisation bias by stripping out the effect of X from D. In a first step, split the sample, train ˆg0(X) based on equation (1) and ˆm0(X) based on equation (2) using one part of the sample. This step is responsible for the name of the approach. In the second step, regress Y−ˆg0(X) on the orthogonalised D: ˆVD=(D−^m0(X))D to obtain ˆθ0 from equation (1) using the main sample. Note that by removing the influence of X on D and subtracting ˆg0(X) from the outcome in the second step removes the regularisation bias. Further, splitting the sample avoids the bias otherwise caused by overfitting (Chernozhukov et al., 2018a: C4–C7). This approach is analogous to a linear instrumental variable (IV) estimator in classical econometrics, where one strips out the non-linear part of Y and includes the estimated residuals from a reduced form regression in the structural equation, and follows the spirit of ‘debiased lasso’ (Belloni and Chernozhukov, 2013; Belloni, Chernozhukov and Hansen, 2014). The DML approach is very flexible with respect to the ML technique applied in the first step. Chernozhukov et al. (2017) use k-fold cross fitting in their illustrative note but any supervised learning approach such as boosted trees, random forests or NNs could be used. DML can also be used to estimate the coefficient of an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model, or the local average treatment effect (Chernozhukov et al., 2017). While it holds much potential for settings with non-linear treatment assignment or outcomes that are non-linear functions of observables, note that this method assumes that the treatment effect itself is additive.\n",
      "To understand the concept of Deep IV, consider the structural equation (following Hartford et al., 2016):  Y=g(D,X)+U(3)where Y is the outcome variable equal to the sum of a potentially non-linear function g(D, X) and an error U with an unconditional mean zero. The vector of covariates X is exogenous, whereas the policy or treatment variable D is correlated with the error U such that E[U|D,X]≠0 and is therefore endogenous. If g(D, X) was linear and an instrument was available, one could apply the typical 2SLS estimation. Here, for a counterfactual prediction, we would like to obtain a function predicting E[Y|D,X] such that  h(D,X)=g(D,X)+E[U|X],(4)i.e. holding the distribution of U constant as D changes. If we had h(D,X), we could identify the effect of changing policy from D0 to D1 through the counterfactual simulation: h(D1,X)−h(D0,X)=g(D1,X)−g(D0,X)⁠. Non-structural ML applied to equation (3), however, would result in a prediction function where the expectation of the error is conditional on the policy variable, and instead obtain E[Y|D,X] = g(D,X)+E[U|D,X]⁠, which is not equal to h(D,X)⁠. Consequently, a counterfactual simulation with this conditional expectation leads to a biased estimation of the policy effect. The availability of a vector of instruments Z, defined as variables excluded from X, relevant for predicting D and uncorrelated with U, allows us to obtain the prediction function in equation (4). Due to the potential (and likely) non-linearity of g(D, X), the approach is somewhat more involved than 2SLS but follows the same logic. Taking expectation of equation (3) conditional on X and Z gives us  E[Y|X,Z]=g(D,X|X,Z)+E[U|X,Z]=∫h(D,X)dF(D|X,Z)(5)where F(D|X,Z) is the conditional distribution of treatment given the covariates and instruments. Hartford et al. (2016) suggest obtaining an estimate of h(D,X) by first learning the distribution of treatment ˆF(D|X,Z)(first stage) and then the expectation of outcome given treatment ˆh(D,X) from minimising a quadratic loss function of the difference between Y and the integral, given ˆF(D|X,Z) (second stage). Note that if g(D,X) and F(D|X,Z) are linear, we return to the traditional 2SLS approach where the integral disappears and two sequential OLS estimates do the trick. Hartford et al. (2017) lay out an ML approach that uses a supervised ML in both the first and second stage. The first stage estimation approach is a straightforward supervised prediction task where flexible ML tools, such as NN, can be used to predict complex non-linear effects of the instruments and controls on treatment. The second stage is also a supervised ML setting. However, training a NN for this task is more complex as it requires evaluating an integral to derive the gradients of the loss function during training. Hartford et al. (2017) propose a stochastic gradient descent approach using MC approximation that can efficiently be applied in a large dataset. The authors stress that the Deep IV approach can be applied using readily available ML techniques without customisation, thereby opening opportunities for applied economics research.\n",

      "2.1. Study site and datasetThe study area corresponds to a Chilean central valley (70°40′7″W, 32°48′11″S) mostly characterized by small agricultural parcels with crops of full canopy coverage and orchards. A WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite image, acquired on 3 December 2011, was used in this study. The WV-2 image has a spatial resolution of 2.4 m and four spectral bands which properties are described in Table 1. To evaluate the proposed approach, two regions of 522 × 522 pixels each were clipped from the WV-2 scene (Figure 1). Figure 1(a,b) correspond to the areas under analysis, from here on called Image A and Image B, respectively. Agricultural parcels in both images have been manually delineated obtaining reference parcel maps.

      "2.2.1. Superpixel processingA superpixel is a small, local, and coherent cluster which contains a statistically homogeneous image region according to certain criteria such as colour, texture, among others (Ren and Malik 2003Ren, X., and J. Malik. 2003. “Learning a Classification Model for Segmentation.” In Computer Vision, 2003. Proceedings. Ninth IEEE International Conference on, October10–17, edited by Bob Werner, Vol. 1. Los Alamitos, California: IEEE. [Google Scholar]). Superpixels are a form of image segmentation, but the focus lies more on an image over-segmentation, not on segmenting meaningful objects (Schick and Stiefelhagen 2011Schick, A., and R. Stiefelhagen. 2011. “Evaluating Image Segments by Applying the Description Length to Sets of Superpixels.” In Computer Vision Workshops (ICCV Workshops), 2011 IEEE International Conference on, 1394–1401. IEEE. [Google Scholar]). In this regard, superpixel processing is not seen as an end in itself but rather a preprocessing step in order to solve a major problem, in this case the efficient analysis of a scene. Superpixel techniques enhance image analysis, e.g. reducing the influence of noise and intra-class spectral variability, preserving most edges of images, and improving the computational speed of later steps such as the segmentation of meaningful objects (Achanta et al. 2012Achanta, R., A. Shaji, K. Smith, A. Lucchi, P. Fua, and S. Süsstrunk. 2012. “SLIC Superpixels Compared to State-Of-The-Art Superpixel Methods.” IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 34 (11): 2274–2282. doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2012.120. [Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]).Superpixel processing is carried out by a modified version of the segmentation method called simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) (Achanta et al. 2012Achanta, R., A. Shaji, K. Smith, A. Lucchi, P. Fua, and S. Süsstrunk. 2012. “SLIC Superpixels Compared to State-Of-The-Art Superpixel Methods.” IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 34 (11): 2274–2282. doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2012.120. [Crossref], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]), which is in turn based on the well-known k-means method, to group image pixels into superpixels. The original SLIC algorithm works in the RGB colour space (defined by only the Red, Green, and Blue spectral bands) and considers two parameters: k, the desired number of superpixels, and c, the compactness factor. A larger value of c emphasizes the importance of the spatial proximity resulting in more compact superpixels. The SLIC version used in this work corresponds to the implemented by Gonzalo Martín et al. (2015Gonzalo Martín, C., E. Menasalvas, M. Lillo Saavedra, D. Fonseca-Luengo, A. Garcia-Pedrero, and R. Costumero. 2015. “Local Optimal Scale in a Hierarchical Segmentation Method for Satellite Images.” Journal of Intelligent Information Systems 46(3): 517-529. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]), which extends the method to work with multispectral images.\n",

      "AbstractEffective crop protection requires early and accurate detection of biotic stress. In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in the early detection of weeds, plant diseases and insect pests in crops. These achievements are related both to the development of non-invasive, high resolution optical sensors and data analysis methods that are able to cope with the resolution, size and complexity of the signals from these sensors. Several methods of machine learning have been utilized for precision agriculture such as support vector machines and neural networks for classification (supervised learning); k-means and self-organizing maps for clustering (unsupervised learning). These methods are able to calculate both linear and non-linear models, require few statistical assumptions and adapt flexibly to a wide range of data characteristics. Successful applications include the early detection of plant diseases based on spectral features and weed detection based on shape descriptors with supervised or unsupervised learning methods. This review gives a short introduction into machine learning, analyses its potential for precision crop protection and provides an overview of instructive examples from different fields of precision agriculture.\n",

      "Land cover mapping (LCM) in complex surface-mined and agricultural landscapes could contribute greatly to regulating mine exploitation and protecting mine geo-environments. However, there are some special and spectrally similar land covers in these landscapes which increase the difficulty in LCM when employing high spatial resolution images. There is currently no research on these mixed complex landscapes. The present study focused on LCM in such a mixed complex landscape located in Wuhan City, China. A procedure combining ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) stereo satellite imagery, the feature selection (FS) method, and machine learning algorithms (MLAs) (random forest, RF; support vector machine, SVM; artificial neural network, ANN) was proposed and first examined for both LCM of surface-mined and agricultural landscapes (MSMAL) and classification of surface-mined land (CSML), respectively. The mean and standard deviation filters of spectral bands and topographic features derived from ZY-3 stereo images were newly introduced. Comparisons of three MLAs, including their sensitivities to FS and whether FS resulted in significant influences, were conducted for the first time in the present study. The following conclusions are drawn. Textures were of little use, and the novel features contributed to improve classification accuracy. Regarding the influence of FS: FS substantially reduced feature set (by 68% for MSMAL and 87% for CSML), and often improved classification accuracies (with an average value of 4.48% for MSMAL using three MLAs, and 11.39% for CSML using RF and SVM); FS showed statistically significant improvements except for ANN-based MSMAL; SVM was most sensitive to FS, followed by ANN and RF. Regarding comparisons of MLAs: for MSMAL based on feature subset, RF achieved the greatest overall accuracy of 77.57%, followed by SVM and ANN; for CSML, SVM had the highest accuracies (87.34%), followed by RF and ANN; based on the feature subsets, significant differences were observed for MSMAL and CSML using any pair of MLAs. In general, the proposed approach can contribute to LCM in complex surface-mined and agricultural landscapes.\n",

The relationship between sixteen remote sensing based drought factors and in situ reference data was modeled through three machine learning approaches: random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist, which have proved to be robust and flexible in many regression tasks. Results showed that random forest produced the best performance (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.3) for SPI prediction among the three approaches. Land surface-related drought factors, e.g., Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Evapotranspiration (ET) showed higher relative importance for short-term meteorological drought while vegetation-related drought factors, e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) showed higher relative importance for long-term meteorological drought by random forest. Six drought factors were selected based on the relative importance by their category to develop drought indicators that represent meteorological and agricultural drought by using the relative importance as weights. While TRMM showed higher relative importance for meteorological drought, LST and NDVI showed higher relative importance for agricultural drought in the arid and humid regions, respectively. Finally, drought distribution maps were produced using the drought indicators and compared with the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) maps, which showed a strong visual agreement.\n"
