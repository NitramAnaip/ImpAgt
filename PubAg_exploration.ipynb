       "   'abstract': 'Management of nitrogen (N) is a challenging task and several methods individually and in combination are in use to manage its efficiency. However, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) has not been improved to a level, only 33%, as predicted by the researchers while developing nitrogen management tools and methods. The primary objective of this review article is to evaluate methods and tools available to manage nitrogen. Several methods, soil testing, plant tissue testing, spectral response, fertilizer placement and timing and vegetative indexes (leaf area index, and NDVI) through drones, handheld sensors, and satellite imagery were reviewed on the subject of user-friendly and effectiveness towards NUE. No single method was found sufficient to counter the nitrogen loss. Some methods were found time consuming and unsynchronized with N uptake behavior of particular crop, for example, plant tissue testing. Use of precision agriculture tools, such as GreenSeeker, Holland Crop Circle, drone, and satellite imagery, were found better compared to conventional methods such as soil testing, but these tools can only be used when the crop is up. Therefore, N management is possible only through inseason N application methods. When 70% of the applied nitrogen is used by the crops within 25–30 days after planting, for example, corn and potatoes, it is required to apply major N rates through inseason approach and some N at planting using soil test reports. In conclusion, this article strongly advocates using two or more methods in combination when managing N.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This paper proposes an integrated framework for software that provides yield data cleaning and yield opportunity index (Y ᵢ) calculation for site-specific crop management (SSCM). The artifacts in many yield data sets, which inevitably occur, can pose a significant effect on the validity of Yi. Automated and standardised yield correction procedures were designed to improve the data quality by removing: (1) unreasonable outliers; (2) distribution outliers (globally and locally); and (3) position errors. The calculation of Yi uses two aspects of crop yield assessment, the magnitude of yield variation and the spatial structure of the variation. The cleaning algorithms were applied to four yield data sets with known integrity issues to demonstrate effectiveness. Approximately 13–20\\xa0% of the original yield data were removed, and this resulted in an increased mean yield of 0.13\\xa0t/ha (average). The semivariograms of cleaned data were shown to possess smaller nugget values compared with the original data. The opportunity index calculation algorithm was demonstrated on a field with nine seasons of yield data. The results demonstrated that using a ranking of Yi provides a rational, agronomic assessment of the opportunity for SSCM based on the quantity and pattern of production variability displayed in yield data sets. This provides farm managers with a rapid way to assess whether the observed variability deserves further investigation and eventual investment in SSCM operations.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The application of crop simulation models in precision agriculture research appears to require only the specification of some input parameters and then running the model for each desired location in a field. Reports in the extensive literature on modeling have described independent tests for different cultivars, soil types and weather, and these have been presumed to validate the model performance in general. However, most of these tests have evaluated model performance for simulating mean yields for multiple plots in yield trials or in other large-area studies. Precision agriculture requires models to simulate not only the mean, but also the spatial variation in yield. No consensus has emerged about how to test model performance rigorously, or what level of performance is sufficient. In addition, many measures of goodness of fit between the observed and simulated data (i.e., model performance) depend on the range of variation in the observed data. If, for example, inter-annual and spatial sources of variation are combined in a test, poor performance in one might be masked by good performance in the other. Our objectives are to: (1) examine research aims that are common in precision agriculture, (2) discuss expectations of model performance, and (3) compare several traditional and some alternative measures of model performance. These measures of performance are explained with examples that illustrate their limitations and strengths. The risk of relying on a test that combines spatial and temporal data was shown with data where the overall fit was good (r ² > 0.8), but the fit within any year was zero. Information gained using these methods can both guide and help to build confidence in future modeling efforts in precision agriculture.',\n",

This study was undertaken to explore the ability to predict P content using canopy reflectance. Some published indices and two ratio spectral indices (Ratio of reflectance index, RRI; Ratio of reflectance difference index, RRDI) developed by band interactive-optimization algorithms were investigated to determine their performance in predicting litchi canopy foliar P content. The results showed that optimal spectral indices selected by correlation analyses reached the highest level of accuracy in the retrieval of P content at each growth stage (R2cv\\u202f=\\u202f0.54–0.98, RMSEcv\\u202f=\\u202f0.02–0.03). The particular wavelengths of importance in the significant RRIs and RRDIs changed with the growing stages, cultivars and planting conditions. The sensitive wavebands ranged from the visible to the short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions, which are related to the absorption features of pigments (e.g., anthocyanin, chlorophyll), proteins, nitrogen, starch, sugar, oil, cellulose, and lignin. And the wavebands in SWIR region were used in the optimal RRIs and RRDIs for growth stages. This study demonstrates that the optimal RRDI is useful in predicting litchi foliar P content. The successes of use of SWIR in foliar nutrient monitoring is important for precision agriculture.',\n",

This requirement suggests an increase in the use of pesticides, which represents an unsustainable chemical load for the environment. To reduce pesticide input and preserve the environment while maintaining the necessary level of food production, the efficiency of relevant processes must be drastically improved. Within this context, this research strived to design, develop, test and assess a new generation of automatic and robotic systems for effective weed and pest control aimed at diminishing the use of agricultural chemical inputs, increasing crop quality and improving the health and safety of production operators.

       "   'abstract': 'The achievement of the objectives of precision agriculture requires not only the development of new technologies, but also the availability of portable tools that can be used in the field. This paper describes the creation of a novel application for mobile devices called pCAPS (portable classification application for plants and soil) that integrates several computer vision techniques for plant segmentation and analysis in crop pictures. This tool allows monitoring of agricultural crops in real time, providing information that can be used to automate and optimize the calculation of water needs. The three main modules of pCAPS are: capture and cropping, image analysis, and historical record. First, a robust algorithm to detect rectangular markers located in the field is proposed; images are trimmed accordingly, in order to achieve a uniform analysis over long periods of time. Then color segmentation is applied using a probabilistic approach based on histograms in the optimum color space. Finally, an object counting process is performed on the binarized images, which is useful in applications that require the number of objects and their average size. Using pCAPS, the user can go with a portable device to a crop field, take a picture with the camera, automatically cut out the image, and perform on the ground an analysis of the vegetation, obtaining the percentage of green cover (PGC), number of plants, date, time, and GPS coordinates. This information can be sent by email to the central offices of the agricultural business, where appropriate decisions on fertirrigation needs would be taken. pCAPS is intuitive, user-friendly and has been developed for use by farm managers, requiring minimal skills in the use of mobile devices.',\n",

Precision farming can reduce the environmental burden by employing site specific crop management practices which implement advanced geospatial technologies for respecting soil heterogeneity. The objectives of this paper are to present the frontier approaches of geospatial (Big) data processing based on satellite and sensor data which both aim at the prevention and mitigation phases of disaster risk reduction in agriculture. Three techniques are presented in order to demonstrate the possibilities of geospatial (Big) data collection in agriculture: (1) farm machinery telemetry for providing data about machinery operations on fields through the developed MapLogAgri application; (2) agrometeorological observation in the form of a wireless sensor network together with the SensLog solution for storing, analysing, and publishing sensor data; and (3) remote sensing for monitoring field spatial variability and crop status by means of freely-available high resolution satellite imagery. The benefits of re-using the techniques in disaster risk reduction processes are discussed. The conducted tests demonstrated the transferability of agricultural techniques to crisis/emergency management domains.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The potential of passive ultra-high frequency radio frequency identification (UHF-RFID) as an electronic identification technology for precision livestock farming applications has been evaluated in different projects. Despite very promising advantages, such as a high read range and simultaneous identification of animals, the application of UHF transponders in ear tags still struggles with the strong influence that body tissue in the vicinity of the transponders has on the reading performance of the system. A detailed and precise investigation of the influence of ears on the transponder ear tags to support transponder development is hardly possible in on-farm tests with animals. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an approach to measure the influence of pig and cattle ears on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and read range of UHF transponder ear tags on a test bench. In a second step, replacement of cattle and pig ears in the experiments with tissue models was tested to enhance the repeatability and comparability of results. Three sets of tests were performed with three different types of UHF transponders (1) to compare the influence on the read range and RSSI of the transponders at the front and back of pig and cattle ears, (2) to determine the repeatability of measurements with ears, and (3) to compare the influence of pig ears with that of two tissue models. Results showed significant differences between the front and back side of the ears for pig ears with better results at the back. The results for cattle ears were heterogeneous. The repeatability of measurements was low in all variants (front and back of pig and cattle ears) with repeatability coefficients of up to 10dBm (RSSI) and 217cm (read range). The tests generally demonstrated the strong and highly variable influence of ear tissue on the read range and RSSI of the transponders. Nevertheless, the results indicated that targeted detuning of UHF transponders can lower the influence of ear tissue on the reading performance, which is promising for the use of UHF-RFID in livestock farming. The method presented could be used in an optimised manner in the future to perform comprehensive tests and comparisons of different types of UHF transponder ear tags.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A primary utility of satellite remote sensing technology is monitoring and assessment of agricultural lands for determining the area, amount, type, and quality of crop production. Since the mid-1970s agricultural scientists have sought to advance this utility through development of precision agriculture (PA) methods and technologies. Consequently, PA has taken advantage of freely available medium-spatial resolution remote sensing technology and instrumented fields to monitor crop biomass, phenology, and yield of crops at the sub-field to larger scales. The main goal of this study was to determine cotton lint yield in a 73-ha irrigated field in western Tennessee using remote sensing technology. We used two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) of Landsat 8 transformed to 8 input predictors including Red, near infra-red (NIR), the simple ratio (SR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), and the tasselled cap transformation’s greenness, wetness, and soil brightness indices: GI, WI, and SBI, respectively, as proxies for cotton lint yield and crop phenology (in this study all input predictors are being referred to as crop indices, CIs). We used artificial neural network (ANN) approach to generate 61,200 models relating individual CIs and CI phenology to field estimates of lint yield to predict and map the field’s cotton lint yield in two cropping seasons. The correlation between cotton lint yield and CIs ranged from -0.20 to 0.60 in 2013 and from −0.79 to 0.84 in 2014. The best ANN models were in 2013 (r\\u202f=\\u202f0.68 and the normalized MAE\\u202f=\\u202f11%) and 2014 (r\\u202f=\\u202f0.86 and the normalized MAE\\u202f=\\u202f8%) growing seasons. The WI and GI were the best CI predictors of cotton lint yield, and overall for the early to mid-season prediction, CI phenologies had better performance than single date CI models. Consequently, we recommend the use of Landsat 8 derived WI or GI phenology to predict crop yields.',\n",

This comprises time-consuming destructive analysis on a daily basis and it does not provide the orchard representative sampling of maturation index (MI), fruit quality parameters (QP) and optimal harvest date (OHD). Prediction maps of crop parameters are an important tool for the delineation of within-field management zones. The objective of this research was to develop a novel approach to optimize crop management in precision agriculture based on the development of a geographical information based decision support system for the prediction of OHD. A non-invasive, low-cost, fast and reliable method based on optical spectroscopy provided accurate and extensive records of both MI and other QP, combined to predict specific-site fruit OHD in two edaphoclimatic conditions of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck 'Newhall' orchards. Overall, we expect to contribute to the state of art in non-invasive technology applied to precision agriculture at non-climacteric fruit by setting up a reliable forecast system for OHD that will optimize crop management, trace back harvested fruit and benefit economically in supply chain. Prediction maps of fruit quality will provide a general pattern of crop distribution and deliver insight into the spatial heterogeneity within a field.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': \"The pace of land degradation has almost doubled across the Western Ghats of India, one of the world's ‘hotspots’ for biodiversity, owing to soil erosion, mining, and rampant urbanization. The arising nutrient depletion leading to land degradation is thus a serious threat to agricultural sustainability in this region. Delineation of spatial soil property maps for nutrient management is an effective strategy for precision agriculture. The present investigation was carried out in North Goa District in Western Ghats, a seldom researched domain in the Indian coastal region. The study involved spatial array analysis of soil properties of 383 georeferenced soil samples and used fuzzy k‐means clustering for delineation of management zones (MZs). Soils were found highly acidic with low available N, P, and medium exchangeable K with a widespread Zn, Cu, and Fe deficiency and sporadic salinity. Soil properties exhibited low to high levels of skewness except for soil pH and Mn. Correlations between soil pH and K, Zn, and Mn, between EC and Fe, between soil organic carbon (SOC) and N, P, K, Cu, and Mn was positive and significant (P\\xa0=\\xa00.01). Geostatistical analysis revealed varied distribution pattern for soil properties with Gaussian (pH, P, and Cu), spherical (EC), stable (SOC), hole effect (N), K‐Bessel (K and Fe), exponential (Zn), and circular (Mn) as best fit semivariogram models with weak and strong spatial dependence. The spatial variability was mapped, and two MZs were delineated. The developed maps will be crucial in site‐specific nutrient management for agricultural and ecological sustainability in the Western Ghats of India.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Monitoring different parameters of interest in a crop has been proven as a useful tool to improve agricultural production. Crop monitoring in precision agriculture may be achieved by a multiplicity of technologies; however the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) results in low-cost and low-power consumption deployments, therefore becoming a dominant option. It is also well-known that crops are also negatively affected by intruders (human or animals) and by insufficient control of the production process. Video-surveillance is a solution to detect and identify intruders as well as to better take care of the production process. In this paper, a new platform called Integrated WSN Solution for Precision Agriculture is proposed. The only cost-effective technology employed is IEEE 802.15.4, and it efficiently integrates crop data acquisition, data transmission to the end-user and video-surveillance tasks. This platform has been evaluated for the particular scenario of scattered crops video-surveillance by using computer simulation and analysis. The telecommunications metrics of choice are energy consumed, probability of frame collision and end-to-end latency, which have been carefully studied to offer the most appropriate wireless network operation. Wireless node prototypes providing agriculture data monitoring, motion detection, camera sensor and long distance data transmission (in the order of several kilometers) are developed. The performance evaluation of this real tests-bed scenario demonstrates the feasibility of the platform designed and confirms the simulation and analytical results.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In situ, non-destructive and real time mineral nutrient stress monitoring is an important aspect of precision farming for rational use of fertilizers. Studies have demonstrated the ability of remote sensing to monitor nitrogen (N) in many crops, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in very few crops and none so far to monitor sulphur (S). Specially designed (1) fertility gradient experiment and (2) test crop experiments were used to check the possibility of mineral N–P–S–K stress detection using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing. Leaf and canopy hyperspectral reflectance data and nutrient status at booting stage of the wheat crop were recorded. N–P–S–K sensitive wavelengths were identified using linear correlation analysis. Eight traditional vegetation indices (VIs) and three proposed (one for P and two for S) were evaluated for plant N–P–S–K predictability. A proposed VI (P_1080_1460) predicted P content with high and significant accuracy (correlation coefficient (r) 0.42 and root means square error (RMSE) 0.180\\xa0g\\xa0m⁻²). Performance of the proposed S VI (S_660_1080) for S concentration and content retrieval was similar whereas prediction accuracies were higher than traditional VIs. Prediction accuracy of linear regressive models improved when biomass-based nutrient contents were considered rather than concentrations. Reflectance in the SWIR region was found to monitor N–P–S–K status in plants in combination with reflectance at either visible (VIS) or near infrared (NIR) region. Newly developed and validated spectral algorithms specific to N, P, S and K can further be used for monitoring in a wheat crop in order to undertake site-specific management.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'LAI of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and soil water content of the topsoil (200\\xa0mm) and of the subsoil (500\\xa0mm) were considered as state variables of a dynamic soil-crop system. This system was assumed to progress according to a Bayesian probabilistic state space model, in which real values of LAI and soil water content were daily introduced in order to correct the model trajectory and reach better future evolution. The chosen crop model was mini STICS which can reduce the computing and execution times while ensuring the robustness of data processing and estimation. To predict simultaneously state variables and model parameters in this non-linear environment, three techniques were used: extended Kalman filtering (EKF), particle filtering (PF), and variational filtering (VF). The significantly improved performance of the VF method when compared to EKF and PF is demonstrated. The variational filter has a low computational complexity and the convergence speed of states and parameters estimation can be adjusted independently. Detailed case studies demonstrated that the root mean square error of the three estimated states (LAI and soil water content of two soil layers) was smaller and that the convergence of all considered parameters was ensured when using VF. Assimilating measurements in a crop model allows accurate prediction of LAI and soil water content at a local scale. As these biophysical properties are key parameters in the crop-plant system characterization, the system has the potential to be used in precision farming to aid farmers and decision makers in developing strategies for site-specific management of inputs, such as fertilizers and water irrigation.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Variable-rate application continues to gain interest among precision agriculture practitioners including the use of crop sensor technology for application of nitrogen in grain crops. For liquid fertilizers, variable-orifice nozzles are being implemented since they provide a much larger nozzle flow range compared to traditional fixed orifice nozzles. However, understanding the performance of variable-orifice nozzles under different field operating conditions has been limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of variable orifice nozzles in support of variable-rate application. Two common variable-orifice nozzles offered by different companies were selected for this study. They were tested over three flow ranges (0.76 to 1.89 L/min) with all tests replicated three times. A commercially available 18.6-m, wet boom sprayer equipped with 37 nozzle bodies was used. Nozzles were numbered but then randomly assigned a position along the boom. To evaluate the performance of an individual nozzle, three random nozzle locations along the spray boom were established for both sets of nozzles. Therefore, 18 tests per replication were required to include the 3 flow rates, 3 different locations, and 2 nozzle types. Once the desired flow rate test was established, tip flow was measured using Spot On Sprayer Calibrator technology. Tip flows were recorded and statistical analyses performed to evaluate flow uniformity (CV) across the boom but also detect off-rate errors by individual nozzles and locations across the boom. With the exception of a few nozzles, the uniformity across the spray boom, as defined by the CV, was acceptable for both nozzle types over approximately a 2:1 flow range. Both nozzle types were less uniform at the low flow rate. There were three nozzles of each type that resulted in unacceptable flow errors in multiple tests.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'LiDAR sensors are widely used in many areas and, in recent years, that includes agricultural tasks. In this work, a self-developed mobile terrestrial laser scanner based on a 2D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor was used to scan an intensive olive orchard, and different algorithms were developed to estimate canopy volume. Canopy volume estimations derived from LiDAR sensor readings were compared to conventional estimations used in fruticulture/horticulture research and the results prove that they are equivalent with coefficients of correlation ranging from r\\xa0=\\xa00.56 to r\\xa0=\\xa00.82 depending on the algorithms used. Additionally, tools related to analysis of point cloud data from the LiDAR-based system are proposed to extract further geometrical and structural information from tree row crop canopies to be offered to farmers and technical advisors as digital raster maps. Having high spatial resolution information on canopy geometry (i.e., height, width and volume) and on canopy structure (i.e., light penetrability, leafiness and porosity) may result in better orchard management decisions. Easily obtainable, reliable information on canopy geometry and structure may favour the development of decision support systems either for irrigation, fertilization or canopy management, as well as for variable rate application of agricultural inputs in the framework of precision fruticulture/horticulture.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A new sensing system to estimate the mass flow of seeds in the grain drill was developed and evaluated in this paper. This was a manipulation of an estimation model developed indoors using fibre sensors; by considering the operational conditions of the machine and environment. Therefore, an original method to install the sensor within the grain drill was tried, and modifications on the estimation model and algorithm were performed.The experiment to test and evaluate the sensing system consisted of running a grain drill-propelling tractor in the farm of Hokkaido University several times to sow rye seeds, where each run was approximately 160m. Two fibre sensors were installed at two different metering units, that use axial flute rollers, inside the grain drill. Also, the seeds being discharged during the experiment were collected and weighed at the end of each run. The results of 52 trials to estimate the mass flow of seeds indicated that in approximately 98% of the trials the estimation rate exceeded 90%. Moreover, the overall estimation rate was approximately 95%. These results seemed not to be biased by the change of the sensor set nor the sensing location.The modifications on the estimation model were successful in eliminating the overestimation or underestimation bias that resulted by changing the speed in the indoor experiments. In addition, the modifications on the estimation algorithm could eliminate error in the sensor output values that may result from dust, vibration, or variation in the sensor internal resistance. These results showed that the sensing system can be used practically to monitor the seed flow in the grain drill which would have many applications in precision agriculture practices.',\n",

The GreenSeeker (GS) sensor with two fixed bands has been applied to improve winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N management in North China Plain (NCP). The Crop Circle (CC) ACS-470 active sensor is user configurable with three wavebands. The objective of this study was to develop a CC ACS-470 sensor-based PNM strategy for winter wheat in NCP and compare it with GS sensor-based N management strategy, soil Nₘᵢₙ test-based in-season N management strategy and conventional farmer’s practice. Four site-years of field N rate experiments were conducted from 2009 to 2013 to identify optimum CC vegetation indices for estimating early season winter wheat plant N uptake (PNU) and grain yield in Quzhou Experiment Station of China Agricultural University located in Hebei province of NCP. Another nine on-farm experiments were conducted at three different villages in Quzhou County in 2012/2013 to evaluate the performance of the developed N management strategy. The results indicated that the CC ACS-470 sensor could significantly improve estimation of early season PNU (R²\\xa0=\\xa00.78) and grain yield (R²\\xa0=\\xa00.62) of winter wheat over GS sensor (R²\\xa0=\\xa00.60 and 0.33, respectively). All three in-season N management strategies achieved similar grain yield as compared with farmer’s practice. The three PNM strategies all significantly reduced N application rates and increased N partial factor productivity (PFP) by an average of 61–67\\xa0%. It is concluded that the CC sensor can improve estimation of early season winter wheat PNU and grain yield as compared to the GS sensor, but the PNM strategies based on these two sensors perform equally well for improving winter wheat NUE in NCP. More studies are needed to further develop and evaluate these active sensor-based PNM strategies under more diverse on-farm conditions.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Precision agriculture relies on site-specific interventions determined by the spatial variability of factors driving plant growth. The main objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of variable-rate seeding of corn (Zea mays L.) with delineated management zones. This study involved two experiments carried out in Não-Me-Toque, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. For the first experiment, carried out in 2009/2010, management zones were delineated by the farmer’s knowledge of the crop field. The field was split into low (LZ), medium (MZ) and high (HZ) crop performance zones. In the second experiment, carried out in 2010/2011, management zones were delineated by overlaying standardized yield data from nine crop seasons (seven of soybean and two of corn). The experiment was carried out with a randomized block design with three management zones and five corn seeding rates ranging from 50\\xa0000 to 90\\xa0000 seeds per ha⁻¹. The soil was a Rhodic Hapludox with a subtropical climate. Optimization of the corn plant population within the field increased grain yield compared to the reference plant population (70\\xa0000 plants ha⁻¹). Yield increases in the LZ, due to corn plant population reduction in relation to the target population, were 1.20 and 1.90\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha⁻¹for first and second experiments, respectively. This resulted in economic gains of 19.8 and 28.7\\xa0%, respectively. Yield increases in the HZ were 0.89 and 0.94\\xa0Mg\\xa0ha⁻¹, respectively, and were due to an increase in plant population in relation to the target population. This resulted in economic gains of 5.6 and 6.6\\xa0% for the first and second experiments, respectively. In the MZ, the adjustment of the target plant population was not necessary. Optimizing corn population according to management zones is a promising tool for precision agriculture in Southern Brazil.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Plant-growth-promoting bacteria show promises in crop production; nevertheless, innovation in their stable delivery is required for practical use by farmers. Herein, the composite of poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(vinylpyrrolidone) plasticized with glycerol and loaded with the microbial consortium (Bacillus subtilis plus Seratia marcescens) was fabricated and engineered onto canola (Brassica napus L.) seed via electrospinning. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the biocomposite is a one-dimensional membrane, which encapsulated microbes in a multilayered nanostructure, and their interfacial behavior between microorganism and seed is beneficial for safer farming. A universal testing machine and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that the biocomposite holds sufficient thermomechanical properties for stable handling and practical management. A spectroscopic study resolved the living hybrid–polymer structure of the biocomposite and proved the plasticizing role of glycerol. A swelling study supports the degradation of the biocomposite in the hydrophilic environment as a result of the leaching of the plasticizer, which is important for the sustained release of microbial cells. A shelf life study supported that the biocomposite seed coat placed a threshold level of microbes [5.675 ± 0.48 log₁₀ colony forming units (CFU)/seed] and maintained their satisfactory viability for 15 days at room temperature. An antifungal and nutrient-solubilizing study supported that the biocomposite seed coat could provide opportunities to biocontrol diseases and improve nutrient acquisition by the plant. A pot study documents the better performance of the biocomposite seed coat on seed germination, seedling growth, leaf area, plant dry biomass, and root system. A chemical and microbial study demonstrated that the biocomposite seed coat improved the effectiveness of the bioinoculant in the root–soil interface, where they survive, flourish, and increase the nutrient pool status. In particular, this study presents advances in the fabrication of the biocomposite for encapsulation, preservation, sustained release, and efficacious use of microorganisms onto seeds for precision farming.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Oil palm is a perennial tree that well fits the humid tropical climate; fresh fruit bunchesare the palm raw fruit for oil mills. Palm oil is the world highest yielding oil crop determining that palms are extensively planted in South-East Asia, especially in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia where plantations have been spreading in response to the increasing market demand. Cultivation of oil palm in tropical countries is an important economic factor, but it has already proved of endangering biodiversity and degrading environment with a global impact related to forest loss. Remote sensing well fits requirements of precision farming that many stakeholders involved in palm oil production are currently approaching to decrease or monitor environmental impacts. In this work, an enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series of 415 images was obtained from the MODIS Vegetation Index 16 days composite product (MOD13Q1-v5) to explore tropical vegetation changes. The EVI time series covers a period of 18 years; it was processed aiming at mapping new oil palm plantations in the reference period, giving an estimate of their age, production, and economic value. In this work, a new methodology for oil palm detection and characterization was presented based on local EVI temporal profile analysis. Pixel EVI temporal profile proved to be effective in describing both vegetation macro-phenology and forest loss at that position. Consequently, the proposed algorithm looks for abrupt changes along the local EVI time series (sudden decreasing). The minimum EVI value recorded in the detected changing period is assumed as a predictor of the starting date of new plantations, being the latter reasonably related to forest loss and preliminary soil preparation. Starting date is then used by the algorithm to estimate oil palm age and, consequently, the present local (potential) production. Accuracy assessment showed an overall accuracy in new palm oil plantation detection of about 94%. Starting age estimation proved to be accurate enough: 76% of the estimates, in fact, were placed in a range of uncertainty of 1 year.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The development of sensors that provide geospatial information on crop and soil conditions has been a primary success for precision agriculture. However, further developments are needed to integrate geospatial data into computer algorithms that spatially optimize crop production while considering potential environmental impacts and resource limitations. The objective of this research was to combine several information technologies, including remote sensing, a cropping system model, and a geographic information system (GIS), to synthesize and interpret geospatial data collected during two irrigation scheduling experiments conducted in 2009 and 2011 in a 5-ha cotton field in central Arizona. The Geospatial Simulation (GeoSim) plug-in for Quantum GIS was used to manage geospatial data and conduct site-specific simulations with the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model. Simulated annealing optimization was used to adjust five model parameters to simulate site-specific conditions in 320 zones across the field. Using input parameters for GeoSim, a multiple criteria objective function was developed to incorporate measured and simulated leaf area index (LAI), crop canopy height, seed cotton yield, and evapotranspiration (ET) for site-specific optimization of CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton. Parameter identifiability and equifinality issues associated with model inversion were investigated. The optimized model was used for post hoc analysis of irrigation rates that maximized site-specific irrigation water use efficiency. With spatial optimization, the model was able to simulate LAI with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 15 and 8\\xa0% in the 2009 and 2011 experiments, respectively. The RMSEs between measured and simulated canopy height, seed cotton yield, and ET were 5\\xa0% or less in both seasons. Some parameters were more identifiable than others during model inversions. Multiple temporal estimates of LAI were effective for constraining the model’s specific leaf area parameter (SLAVR, cm² g⁻¹), but lack of information on root growth reduce identifiability of a parameter related to that process (SRGF0). Post-hoc simulation analysis of irrigation management options showed that irrigation schedules based on remotely sensed vegetation indices increased irrigation water use efficiency as compared to traditional scheduling methods, particularly in the 2009 growing season. In 2011, the analysis showed that all scheduling methods resulted in excess irrigation application, and higher deep seepage rates were simulated in that season. Taken together, the results demonstrate that well-designed software tools and algorithms for data processing and interpretation can be potentially transformative for integrating multiple geospatial data sets to compute optimum scenarios for precision irrigation management.',\n",

Models that have been proposed thus far are still limited in their application because of sensitivity to outdoor illumination conditions and the inherent difficulty in modeling complex plant shapes using only radiometric information. Assuming that not all of the plant-related pixels are essential for growth estimation, this study proposes a 3D reconstruction model that focuses on selected salient features on the plant surface, which are sufficient for obtaining growth characteristics. In addition, by introducing a hue-invariant model, the proposed algorithm shows robustness to diverse outdoor illumination conditions. The algorithm was tested under greenhouse and field conditions on corn, cotton, sunflower, tomato and black nightshade plants, from young seedlings to fully developed plant growth stages, and accurately estimated height (error ~4.5\\xa0%) and leaf cover area (error ~5\\xa0%). Furthermore, a strong correlation (r²\\xa0~0.92) was found between the plant’s estimated volume and measured biomass, yielding an accurate biomass estimator in the validation tests (error ~4.5\\xa0%). This estimation ability remained stable while applying the model on plants with varying densities (overlapping leaves) and imaging setups where the standard 2D based analyses failed, thus showing the 3D modeling contribution to robust growth estimation models.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'With more dairy cows being housed indoors, for at least part of the year, it is important to understand how housing impacts on ‘normal behaviour’ and the implications for cow welfare. For cows on pasture, nutritional requirements and climatic conditions are the major concerns, whilst indoor housing systems can restrict natural behaviours and reduce health as incidences of lameness and mastitis increase. When given a choice to be at pasture or in cubicle housing, studies have shown that time of day, season, and where feed is provided can influence preference. Previous experience also had a big effect on pasture preference: the longer calves/heifers/cows were reared without experience of pasture the stronger their preference for housing. The ontogeny of grazing also requires pasture experience i.e. the instinctive foraging behaviour of calves is to suckle and they have to learn through experience how to graze. These results raise the question: if cattle are to be housed for part of the year, would it be better to house them continuously? Other results would suggest not, as there are clear production, health and welfare benefits to pasture access. Cows at pasture had lower levels of lameness and mastitis, and cows with free access to pasture and indoor housing also produced more milk than those continuously housed. Approximately half of this extra milk was attributed to grass intake, and increased lying, improved comfort and/or lower stress probably accounted for the rest. Although incorporating free access between housing and pasture is difficult on many farms, it is postulated that developments in precision livestock farming offer the potential to provide a technological solution to this problem. These research findings could be used as the basis to design novel, adaptive housing that responds to cow behaviour. The aim would be to incorporate the best aspects of pasture with the best aspects of housing to provide an environment that meets the needs of the cows all year around.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In the southeastern United States, Amaranthus, or pigweed species, have become troublesome weeds in agricultural systems. To implement management strategies for the control of these species, agriculturalists need information on areas affected by pigweeds. Geographic information systems (GIS) afford users the ability to evaluate agricultural issues at local, county, state, national, and global levels. Also, they allow users to combine different layers of geographic information to help them develop strategic plans to solve problems. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in testing free and open-source GIS software for weed surveys. In this study, the free and open-source software QGIS was used to develop a geographic information database showing the distribution of pigweeds at the county level in the southeastern United States. The maps focused on the following pigweeds: Palmer amaranth, redroot pigweed, and tall waterhemp. Cultivated areas and glyphosate-resistant (GR) pigweed data were added to the GIS database. Database queries were used to demonstrate applications of the GIS for precision agriculture applications at the county level, such as tallying the number of counties affected by the pigweeds, identifying counties reporting GR pigweed, and identifying cultivated areas located in counties with GR pigweeds. This research demonstrated that free and open-source software such as QGIS has strong potential as a decision support tool, with implications for precision weed management at the county scale.

       "   'abstract': 'Precision farming technologies represent an innovation challenge in terms of their diffusion into farming practice, and create a new dynamic for research and extension roles. The purpose of this paper is to examine the interaction and distribution of research and extension roles of public, private, and agricultural industry organizations in precision farming innovation systems. We connect findings to the broader debates on role divisions of public and private research and extension in innovation systems. Two case studies were examined: precision dairy farming in Australia, and the use of automatic milking systems in north-western Europe. A timeline analysis method, underpinned by a functions of innovation systems framework, was used to examine activities of actors and organizations in the case studies. Three main findings were: 1) Complex agricultural innovations require a collaborative approach for successful innovation and diffusion. The need for, and type of, collaboration differs across scales from farm-level (individual learning) to a national and global level with issues of skill training and service provider capability. Additionally, a threshold scale is required before the commercial sector can operate effectively. 2) The presence, and limitations, of private (commercial) interests and their position as a key knowledge base in precision farming heightens the need for public research and extension organizations to promote collaborative innovation programs with technology companies. There is a key public or industry good role in providing ‘back-office’ activities to support and complement private ‘front office’ activities. 3) Public and private research and extension organizations can work together, however there are areas where it makes more sense for one party or the other to lead. For precision farming systems, the roles for public organizations involve leadership on data integration (on-farm and off-farm), integration of technology (via standards), testing equipment performance, and development of training programs including support of initiatives such as farmer clubs. The principle theoretical implication is that public, private and industry roles in research and extension should not be viewed as dichotomous (e.g. pre-competitive/competitive), but as highly fluid in terms of the moments they are needed, and the scale at which they are needed, within the technological innovation system.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Monitoring the effects of water availability on vegetation globally using satellites is important for applications such as drought early warning, precision agriculture, and food security as well as for more broadly understanding relationships between water and carbon cycles. In this global study, we examine how quickly several satellite-based indicators, assumed to have relationships with water availability, respond, on timescales of days to weeks, in comparison with variations in root-zone soil moisture (RZM) that extends to about 1\\u202fm depth. The satellite indicators considered are the normalized difference vegetation and infrared indices (NDVI and NDII, respectively) derived from reflectances obtained with moderately wide (20–40\\u202fnm) spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimated from thermal infrared observations and normalized by a reference ET. NDVI is primarily sensitive to chlorophyll contributions and vegetation structure while NDII may contain additional information on water content in leaves and canopy. ET includes both the loss of root zone soil water through transpiration (modulated by stomatal conductance) as well as evaporation from bare soil. We find that variations of these satellite-based drought indicators on time scales of days to weeks have significant correlations with those of RZM in the same water-limited geographical locations that are dominated by grasslands, shrublands, and savannas whose root systems are generally contained within the 1\\u202fm RZM layer. Normalized ET interannual variations show generally a faster response to water deficits and enhancements as compared with those of NDVI and NDII, particularly in sparsely vegetated regions.',\n",

For this purpose, a complete segmentation algorithm has been developed for a case study on apple fruit segmentation in outdoor conditions using aerial images. This algorithm has been trained and tested using videos with 16 different light intensities from apple orchards during the day. The proposed segmentation algorithm consists of five main steps: (1) transforming frames in RGB to CIE L*u*v* color space and applying thresholds on image pixels; (2) computing texture features of local standard deviation; (3) using intensity transformation to remove background pixels; (4) color segmentation applying different thresholds in RGB space; and (5) applying morphological operators to refine the results. During the training process of this algorithm, it was observed that frames in different light conditions had more than 58% color sharing. Results showed that the accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm is higher than 99.12%, outperforming other methods in the state of the art that were compared. The processed images are aerial photographs like those obtained from a camera installed in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This accurate result will enable more efficient support in the decision making for irrigation and harvesting strategies.',\n",

This paper describes a novel automatic observation system for wheat heading stage based on computer vision. Images compliant with statistical requirements are taken in natural conditions where illumination changes frequently. Wheat plants with low spatial resolution overlap substantially, which increases observational difficulties. To adapt to the complex environment, a two-step coarse-to-fine wheat ear detection mechanism is proposed. In the coarse-detection step, machine learning technology is used to emphasise the candidate ear regions. In the fine-detection step, non-ear areas are eliminated through higher-level features. For that purpose, scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is densely extracted as the low-level visual descriptor, then Fisher vector (FV) encoding is employed to generate the mid-level representation. Based on three consecutive year's data of seven image sequences, a series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposition. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other existing methods with an average value of absolute error of 1.14 days on the test dataset. The results indicate that automatic observation is quite acceptable compared to manual observations.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is being developed in livestock farms to relieve the human workload and to help farmers to optimize production and management procedure. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the consequences in energy intensity and the related carbon impact, from dairy farm to cheese factory, due to the implementation of a real-time milk analysis and separation (AfiMilk MCS) in milking parlors. The research carried out involved three conventional dairy farms, the collection and delivery of milk from dairy farms to cheese factory and the processing line of a traditional soft cheese into a dairy factory. The AfiMilk MCS system installed in the milking parlors allowed to obtain a large number of information related to the quantity and quality of milk from each individual cow and to separate milk with two different composition (one with high coagulation properties and the other one with low coagulation properties), with different percentage of separation. Due to the presence of an additional milkline and the AfiMilk MCS components, the energy requirements and the related environmental impact at farm level were slightly higher, among 1.1% and 4.4%. The logistic of milk collection was also significantly reorganized in view of the collection of two separate type of milk, hence, it leads an increment of 44% of the energy requirements. The logistic of milk collection and delivery represents the process which the highest incidence in energy consumption occurred after the installation of the PLF technology. Thanks to the availability of milk with high coagulation properties, the dairy plant, produced traditional soft cheese avoiding the standardization of the formula, as a result, the energy uses decreased about 44%, while considering the whole chain, the emissions of carbon dioxide was reduced by 69%. In this study, the application of advance technologies in milking parlors modified not only the on-farm management but mainly the procedure carried out in cheese making plant. This aspect makes precision livestock farming implementation unimportant technology that may provide important benefits throughout the overall milk chain, avoiding about 2.65 MJ of primary energy every 100 kg of processed milk.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Cotton fiber quality has been emphasized by breeders, ginners, and textile processors but not among growers as an in-season crop-management consideration. Whereas many studies have shown in-field cotton fiber-quality variation, the amount observed is usually small compared to that of lint yield, casting doubt on the usefulness of site-specific crop management for fiber-quality improvement. The goal of this study was to elucidate the inter-related effects of lint yield and fiber quality on in-field revenue variation. With more clarity in this regard, growers can better understand how to improve revenue and potentially profit, and determine whether it would be worthwhile for them to manage fiber quality on a site-specific basis. Field studies were conducted in two cotton fields near College Station, Texas. Lint yield and fiber quality data were collected. Loan-rate maps were produced by integrating fiber-quality parameter maps with the USDA-CCC Loan Schedules, and gross revenue maps were produced by combining lint-yield and loan-rate maps. In-field variation of revenue was separated into two components: one associated with in-field variation of lint yield and the other associated with in-field variation of fiber quality. The results showed that, for the first field, the standard deviation (SD) of revenue was $181 ha-1 ($73.2 ac.-1), with fiber quality variation being about 13% as important as yield variation. In the second field, the SD of revenue was $216 ha-1 ($87.4 ac.-1), with fiber quality variation being about 31% as important. While lint yield was the primary factor in determining overall revenue, the contribution of fiber quality was substantial and should not be overlooked, especially when high input costs and small profit margins are considered.',\n",

Yields from plots receiving intermediate N rates in the maize study indicated a probable dependence between grain yield and yield response index, which is contrary to the authorsâ\\x80\\x99 conclusions. Data from a more recent, long-term irrigated maize study on a similar soil type were used to illustrate that grain yield and yield response index are definitely dependent on each other and further that the in-season sensor-based sufficiency index is highly correlated with relative yield.

       "   'abstract': 'The impact of structural parameters of agricultural crops on the retrieval of chlorophyll content presents a real challenge for the remote-sensing community. Canopy reflectance can differ between crops of different canopy structure even when they have the same canopy chlorophyll content. Thus, structural properties should be incorporated in chlorophyll mapping to reduce modelling errors. The empirical relationships between vegetation indices and chlorophyll content are well established and commonly used in precision agriculture. Recent advances in using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV/drone) technology offer successful retrieval of crop structural and biochemical parameters. However, transfer of empirical algorithms derived from satellite to UAV-based analyses introduces new challenges mainly due to fine spatial resolution and details such as crop rows and between- and within-canopy gaps that are more pronounced in UAV images. There are two components of the analysis in this study. The first part is related to heterogeneity of leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content of corn under four agricultural treatments (conventional ploughed, conventional with no tilling, biological with reduced chemical inputs, and certified organic) at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research (KBS LTER) site in Michigan, USA. The second part examines the necessity and importance of LAI in chlorophyll mapping using UAV images collected over the heterogeneous KBS LTER parcels at peak growing season. The UAV-derived normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) is found to be highly correlated with canopy chlorophyll, calculated as a product of leaf chlorophyll content and LAI. The coefficient of determination changes from R²\\xa0=\\xa00.177 to R²\\xa0=\\xa00.774 when LAI is added to the empirical model. NDRE is also found to be highly correlated with LAI (R²\\xa0=\\xa00.620). The findings suggest that the conventional corn treatment with no-tilled soil exhibits the highest crop vigour during the peak growing season. The herbicide management applied earlier in the season may have a strong effect on weeds, reducing the crop–weeds competition for nutrients.',\n",

This study utilized Android-based Nexus 7 tablets and tested the operation of the three location services available on this system in a 24-h fixed location test and a shorter duration multiple location field test. In the 24-h test, the 'network' location system had a measured error of 37.19 m while reporting an accuracy of 55.56 m. The 'gps' location system had a measured error of 2.57 m and a reported accuracy of 3.20 m. Multiple tests were conducted with the location system added by Google Services code because the measured error was much higher than the reported accuracy. With this system, the measured errors were 14.13, 3.4, 24.08, 14.01, and 16.15 m with reported accuracies of 3.95, 4.83, 3.99, 7.18, and 6.68 m, respectively. All the tests with the Google Services location system had much higher variability in location estimates than the 'gps' location system. For both services, the high values for reported accuracy did not correspond with high values for measured error. Field testing was only performed with the Google Services and 'gps' location systems as the 'network' location system did not operate in the test field. Statistical analysis confirmed that the 'gps' system was more accurate in this testing but the difference was not as dramatic as in the 24-h testing. The average reported accuracy level was 3.0 m in all field tests with the 'gps' system and 3.9 m in all field tests with the Google Services system. The field test data were also used to estimate areas of 0.14-ha rectangular plots. Among all three tests with the 'gps' system and all three tests with the Google Services system, the mean absolute area percent error varied from 4% to 7%, and in every test at least one plot was over- or underestimated by at least 10%. The error characteristics and patterns for all but the 'gps' service differed significantly from the random walk pattern and/or other characteristics of GNSS locators to which precision farming engineers have become accustomed. Mobile platform creators like Apple and Google are either requiring (Apple) or strongly encouraging (Google) developers to switch to newer services that don't provide access to the underlying locating mechanism. Therefore, it is clear that careful consideration of these differences and what they may mean to location based apps in agriculture will be important. This work highlights the importance of testing any 'smart' devices to determine actual location accuracy before relying on them for making agricultural decisions based on their output.\",\n",

Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors’ data acquisition and intelligent processing, are bridging the gaps between the cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation management systems can help in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in the precision farming landscape. This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information processing results of three weeks data based on the proposed algorithm. The system is fully functional and the prediction results are very encouraging.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Temporal and spatial resolution of satellite images are coarse and cannot provide the real-time, meter-scale resolution monitoring required in many applications, such as precision agriculture. Since high resolution thermal infrared data provide one means to observe canopy temperature variance, we developed an algorithm (three-temperature model, 3T) to estimate transpiration rate at meter-scale pixels and detected transpiration variation for soybean under different upper irrigation limits: No irrigation, 35% of field capacity (FC), 55% of FC, and 75% of FC, denoted as W<inf>0</inf>, W<inf>1</inf>, W<inf>2</inf>, and W<inf>3</inf>, respectively. The spatial patterns of the transpiration rate indicated that heterogeneity is common in farmland. Transpiration rates in the wet treatment (i.e., W<inf>3</inf>) were consistently higher than that in the dry treatment (i.e., W<inf>0</inf>). Transpiration rates reached peak values at around 12:30&ndash;14:30 and most of values showed that W<inf>3</inf> > W<inf>2</inf> > W<inf>1</inf> > W<inf>0</inf>, with 0.91 mm/h, 0.89 mm/h, 0.79 mm/h, and 0.62 mm/h during the reproductive period, respectively. In general, the transpiration rate of soybean increased with increasing irrigation quantities. With a higher irrigation total, soil water content increased gradually, and then the transpiration rate increased. Although land surface temperature decreased by only 8.57 K (Kelvin), 6.33 K, and 5.47 K, respectively, the transpiration rate increased by 78%, 60%, and 40%, respectively, for the W<inf>3</inf>, W<inf>2</inf>, and W<inf>1</inf> treatment compared with the W<inf>0</inf> treatment. The magnitude of transpiration change is greater than that of canopy temperature, but both parameters are strongly interrelated with each other through a non-linear correlation. Heterogeneity of canopy leaf temperature and transpiration is mainly due to physical and biological interactions. Understanding transpiration rate and canopy temperature heterogeneity under different irrigation treatments can not only help in scheduling irrigation, but also in enhancing water utilization efficiency in irrigated agriculture. The real-time monitoring of crop transpiration at meter-scale is of great importance for large irrigation systems, especially for precision irrigation, and will have great application prospects in the near future.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Precision Beekeeping (PB), a sub-branch of Precision Agriculture, is an apiary management strategy based on the monitoring of individual bee colonies to minimise resource consumption and maximise the productivity of bees. Although there are sufficient technical means and industrial products for the practical execution of PB, the process is slow due to the differing states of development of three implementation phases: data collection, data analysis and application.The technical execution, adequacy of earlier and current solutions and development perspectives are analysed to prioritise different challenges for PB. The development of decision support systems, which is usually a stumbling block in Precision Agriculture, is suggested to be a mid-term task. In the long term, specific DSS-controlled electronic devices should be developed to enable new functionalities for PB. Specific classes of actors are proposed to operate within future PB systems for the automatic execution of suggestions made by decision support systems, as well as for diagnostic purposes.PB systems should be optimised by searching for appropriate combinations of different sensors, and corresponding decision support systems must provide convenient, reliable and cost efficient solutions. The development and specification of PB systems should consider business interests, distance to the apiary, expected risks and other peculiarities.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Orthomosaics derived from consumer grade digital cameras on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used for biodiversity monitoring and remote sensing of the environment. To have lasting quantitative value, remotely sensed imagery should be calibrated to physical units of reflectance. Radiometric calibration improves the quality of raw imagery for consistent quantitative analysis and comparison across different calibrated imagery. Moreover, calibrating remotely sensed imagery to units of reflectance improves its usefulness for deriving quantitative biochemical and biophysical metrics. Notwithstanding the existing radiometric calibration procedures for correcting single images, studies on radiometric calibration of UAV-derived orthomosaics remain scarce. In particular, this study presents a cost- and time-efficient radiometric calibration framework for designing calibration targets, checking scene illumination uniformity, converting orthomosaic digital numbers to units of reflectance, and accuracy assessment using in situ mean reflectance measurements (i.e. the average reflectance in a particular waveband). The empirical line method was adopted for the development of radiometric calibration prediction equations using mean reflectance values measured in only one spot within a 97 ha orthomosaic for three wavebands, i.e. red, green and blue of the Sony NEX-7 camera. A scene illumination uniformity check experiment was conducted to establish whether 10 randomly distributed regions within the orthomosaic experienced similar atmospheric and illumination conditions. This methodological framework was tested in a relatively flat terrain semi-arid woodland that is invaded by Harrisia pomanensis (the Midnight Lady). The scene illumination uniformity check results showed that at a 95% confidence interval, the prediction equations developed using mean reflectance values measured from only one spot within the scene can be used to calibrate the entire 97 ha RGB orthomosaic. Furthermore, the radiometric calibration accuracy assessment results showed a correlation coefficient r value of 0.977 (p\\xa0<\\xa00.01) between measured and estimated reflectance values with an overall root mean square error of 0.063. These findings suggest that given the entire scene being mapped is experiencing similar atmospheric and illumination conditions, then prediction equations developed using mean reflectance values measured in only one spot within the scene can be used to calibrate the entire orthomosaic in semi-arid woodlands. The proposed methodological framework can potentially be tested and adapted for use in large-scale crop mapping and monitoring in precision agriculture, land-use/land-cover classification as well as plant species delimitation, particularly for mapping widespread invasive alien plants such as H. pomanensis.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Soil mapping has been identified as key to environmental issues. The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614\\u202fkm². The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the ‘true’ but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In the southeast of Spain, farmers usually resort to the Agricultural Information Service of Murcia (SIAM) to get the data needed for an estimation of their water use and needs. Through 48 automatic stations, the SIAM provides data about temperature, wind speed, solar radiation or humidity, on a not very user-friendly web page which is not adapted to mobile devices and shows some shortcomings in downloading data. In addition, the key reference parameter in irrigation, the daily reference evapotranspiration (ET ₒ), is not provided on the current day and the hourly ET ₒ and the crop evapotranspiration (ET c) are not offered either. This paper presents a new software application for mobile devices capable of providing the required data by an easy-to-use and friendly app. This tool employs the GPS co-ordinates of a place under study to get the data required from the closest SIAM stations and interpolates station data to increase accuracy. The hourly and daily ET ₒ are automatically calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation, declared by the FAO in 1990 as the only valid method for calculating evapotranspiration. The ET ₒ computation entails the calculation of the net solar radiation, the heat soil flux or the psychometric constant. A new extension of the tool also allows calculation of the ET c for a set of typical crops of the southeast of Spain. All the computed data can be stored and edited, as well as those geographical positions of interest. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first application of this kind available.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"A simple and transparent analytical model for C3-crop biomass accumulation is introduced. The model is aimed to be used as a decision tool in precision farming. It is valid when growth is limited only by radiation or water and gives the optimal (maximum) biomass. It contains 8 fixed parameters, all with a clear basis in physics, chemistry and physiology. As a function of time, the growth is divided into two phases: exponential and linear. At an early stage of growth, the growth is exponential due to the expanding leaf area of the crop. At this stage, the model needs 6 parameters. The growth becomes linear when the leaf area is adequate to use all possible radiation. The model needs 2 parameters at this later stage. Water-limited growth needs an additional set of 4 parameters to describe phenomena of water related processes. When water is a limiting factor, the root-growth model becomes critical because the daily root growth determines the crop's growth directly. The model was tested first against field data at one point where all relevant inputs and parameters of the model were measured. Despite the simplicity of the model, there was a good agreement between simulated and measured values of biomass and leaf area. A scenario is described to show how the model may be used in practice and what kind of field data is needed. In on-line precision farming the key factor is the amount of radiation used by the crop, which can be measured adequately with two sensors, one above and one below the canopy.\",\n",

A Just‐Pope stochastic frontier production function is estimated using data from a survey of canola producers. Yield is modeled as a function of nutrients and precipitation. A linear inefficiency function includes farm specific variables and a set of binary variables representing BMP adoption. BMP variables for nutrient management planning and precision farming are positively related to technical efficiency while results for the other BMP indicators are mixed. Model estimates appear to be significantly influenced by moisture problems that occurred through the Prairie region during the 2011 cropping year.

       "   'abstract': 'Soil moisture sensors are increasingly deployed in sensor networks for both agronomic research and precision agriculture. Soil-specific calibration improves the accuracy of soil water content sensors, but laboratory calibration of individual sensors is not practical for networks installed across heterogeneous settings. Using daily water content readings collected from a sensor network (42 locations×5 depths=210 sensors) installed at the Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) near Pullman, Washington, we developed an automated calibration approach that can be applied to individual sensors after installation. As a first step, we converted sensor-based estimates of apparent dielectric permittivity to volumetric water content using three different calibration equations (Topp equation, CAF laboratory calibration, and the complex refractive index model, or CRIM). In a second, “re-calibration” step, we used two pedotransfer functions based upon particle size fractions and/or bulk density to estimate water content at wilting point, field capacity, and saturation at each sensor insertion point. Using an automated routine, we extracted the same three reference points, when present, from each sensor’s record, and then bias-corrected and re-scaled the sensor data to match the estimated reference points. Based on validation with field-collected cores, the Topp equation provided the most accurate calibration with an RMSE of 0.074m3m−3, but automated re-calibration with a local pedotransfer function outperformed any of the calibrations alone, yielding a network-wide RMSE of 0.055m3m−3. The initial calibration equation used in the first step was irrelevant when the re-calibration was applied. After correcting for the reference core measurement error of 0.026m3m−3 used for calibration and validation, the error of the sensors alone (RMSEadj) was computed as 0.049m3m−3. Sixty-five percent of individual sensors exhibited re-calibration errors less than or equal to the network RMSEadj. The incorporation of soil physical information at sensor installation sites, applied retroactively via an automated routine to in situ soil water content sensors, substantially improved network sensor accuracy.',\n",

Harvest area for a basket load of cotton is recorded with GPS, and the module into which a basket is dumped is tracked through wireless communication among the sub-systems. In three field tests, the system was easily installed on equipment and performed as designed. Fiber-quality maps were produced by combining the GPS-based module area data collected during harvest with bale-level fiber-quality data measured at a cotton classing office after ginning.

       "   'abstract': 'One of the objectives of precision agriculture is to minimize the volume of herbicides by using site-specific weed management systems. To reach this goal, two major factors need to be considered: (1) the similarity of spectral signatures, shapes, and textures between weeds and crops and (2) irregular distribution of weeds within the crop. This paper outlines an automatic computer vision method for detecting Avena sterilis, a noxious weed growing in cereal crops, and differential spraying to control the weed. The proposed method determines the quantity and distribution of weeds in the crop fields and applies a decision-making strategy for selective spraying, which forms the main focus of the paper. The method consists of two stages: image segmentation and decision-making. The image segmentation process extracts cells from the image as the low-level units. The quantity and distribution of weeds in the cell are mapped as area and structural based attributes, respectively. From these attributes, a multicriteria decision-making approach under a fuzzy context allows us to decide whether any given cell needs to be sprayed. The method was compared with other existing strategies.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-robot systems where heterogeneous robots cooperate to perform a complex mission. A general requirement in a task allocation algorithm is to find an optimal set of robots to execute a certain task. This paper presents the work that harnesses an area decomposition algorithm, and a space-based middleware to facilitate task allocation process in unstructured and dynamic environments. To reduce spatial interference between robots, area decomposition algorithm divides a working area into cells which are then dynamically assigned to robots. In addition, coordination and collaboration among distributed robots are realized through a space-based middleware. For this purpose, the space-based middleware is extended with a semantic model of robot capabilities to improve task selection in terms of flexibility, scalability, and reduced communication overhead during task allocation. In this way a framework which exploits the synergy of area decomposition and semantically enriched space-based approach is created. We conducted performance tests in a specific precision agriculture use case focusing on the utilization of a robotic fleet for weed control introduced in the European Project RHEA – Robot Fleets for Highly Effective Agriculture and Forestry Management.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The objective of this study was to carry out a comparative analysis of the costs and economic profitability and viability indicators involved in implementing precision and conventional farming practices using maize and soybean crops in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. After identifying the production costs, analyses of the profitability indicators and viability indicators were carried out. The calculated profitability indicators (gross revenue, gross margin, break-even point, operational profit, and profitability index) presented better economic results under the precision system. For the analysis of the viability indicators, the net present value method and the internal rate of return method were used to analyze the two production systems, showing smaller investment attractiveness for the conventional farming system than for the precision system, though with a small difference in values. The Monte Carlo method was applied to evaluate investment risk. The selection of the variables to be simulated was based on the sensitivity analysis results, such as production, sale price and input price. The results obtained through simulation led to the conclusion that the risks are low for the two production systems analyzed.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Comprehensive surface soil moisture (SM) monitoring is a vital task in precision agriculture applications. SM monitoring includes remote sensing imagery monitoring and in situ sensor-based observational monitoring. Cloud computing can increase computational efficiency enormously. A geographical web service was developed to assist in agronomic decision making, and this tool can be scaled to any location and crop. By integrating cloud computing and the web service-enabled information infrastructure, this study uses the cloud computing-enabled spatio-temporal cyber-physical infrastructure (CESCI) to provide an efficient solution for soil moisture monitoring in precision agriculture. On the server side of CESCI, diverse Open Geospatial Consortium web services work closely with each other. Hubei Province, located on the Jianghan Plain in central China, is selected as the remote sensing study area in the experiment. The Baoxie scientific experimental field in Wuhan City is selected as the in situ sensor study area. The results show that the proposed method enhances the efficiency of remote sensing imagery mapping and in situ soil moisture interpolation. In addition, the proposed method is compared to other existing precision agriculture infrastructures. In this comparison, the proposed infrastructure performs soil moisture mapping in Hubei Province in 1.4 min and near real-time in situ soil moisture interpolation in an efficient manner. Moreover, an enhanced performance monitoring method can help to reduce costs in precision agriculture monitoring, as well as increasing agricultural productivity and farmers’ net-income.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The understanding of actual and potential data-flows in the practice of precision agriculture (PA) is an essential prerequisite for the optimisation and automation of information management in this field. As a contribution to this process, this paper presents an analysis of the data-flows within the work of a collaborative research project concerned with the testing of the methods developed within the project on two demonstration fields. This work provides a good case study for the modelling of a range of data-flows covering a broad spectrum of PA techniques. Using the notation and software tools for the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a complete model of all identified data-flows was created. Individual data-streams relating to particular source or product datasets were then extracted from this model. These data-streams present a practical application of the model in identifying the benefit that may be obtained from a particular gathered dataset (e.g. yield data) or in identifying the data that must be gathered to generate a particular product dataset (e.g. sustainability indicators). Whilst the current model is focussed on one particular research project, it has potential to be extended to cover more generally the common practice of precision agriculture. Such a model may then be used by farmers as a roadmap for the adoption for precision agriculture by allowing them to determine what datasets are available to them or may be easily collected and what products they may generate from these, or vice versa to identify what datasets they must obtain in order to generate a particular dataset of interest.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'In precision agriculture, the efficient use of fertilizer in order to minimize consumption is important. The amount of fertilizer supplied needs to match the amount consumed by the plant. However, it is difficult to estimate the amount absorbed by the roots. The absorption of the fertilizer has to be determined by continually measuring its distribution on a millimeter scale, which is the scale of the around root. In this study, we developed an electrical conductivity sensor array system that can be used to continuously measure the distribution of fertilizer with clarity using several millimeter sized electrical conductivity sensors inserted in the soil. The electrical conductivity sensor array system measuring unit is comprised an array of five electrical conductivity sensor chips which size is 5mm×5mm. The distribution in two different model soil mixtures was measured continuously using the ECSAS to confirm its capability for measuring the diffusion of the fertilizer. The progress of fertilizer diffusion was confirmed with the change in ECw decreasing over time. The ECSAS was used to measure the distribution of ECw in model soil with the dissolution of solid fertilizer for six days to examine the validity and characteristics of the ECw measurements and the benefits of the ECSAS. As a result, it was confirmed that ECSAS can be used to measure the change in the distribution of ECw due to the dissolution and subsequent diffusion of solid fertilizer in real time on a scale of less than a centimeter. Thus, we consider that the ECSAS will become a very valuable system for continuously measuring the dissolution and diffusion of fertilizer in small areas of soil such as on the scale of rhizospheres.',\n",

This review focuses on microbial inoculants including bacteria, fungi, and viruses used as biostimulant or biocontrol agent for foliar application and covers all important steps from inoculant development to successful field application. Topics presented comprise typical spraying equipment including the importance of the spraying process and relating effects, furthermore formulation development including classification and adjuvants, and thirdly regulatory aspects as currently applied or under discussion. Microbial inoculants for foliar spray reported in scientific literature are summarized and contrasted with selected commercial products. Special attention is given to factors most important in microbial spray: (a) type of active ingredient (bacteria, fungi, viruses), (b) mode of action (ingestion, contact, competition), (c) interaction with the plant leaf surface, (d) droplet size in terms of microbe concentration and leaf coverage, and (e) environmental conditions during spraying. Finally, we want to emphasize that timely administration is of utmost importance for successful spraying and maximum efficacy. This might be supported by weather stations and disease/pest models as an important step towards precision farming.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Cavendish banana 'Kluai Hom Thong' (Musa sapientum AAA group 'Kluai Hom Thong') is the most popular fruit in Thailand, that is grown in many regions for local supply (113.7 M t or 96.93%) and export to China and Japan (3.7 M t or 3.17%). However, premium quality of banana, especially from organic certified farms, is the minimal requirement for export. The aim of this research was to develop organic fertilizer practices for the production of premium quality banana. The study was conducted in three farmer fields at Rong Kwang district, Phrae province, northern Thailand. The physiological, morphological characters and fruit yield of banana grown under biofertilizer treatment (farm yard manure (FYM) with arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF-plant growth promoting fungi)) and without biofertilizer were measured. Total chlorophyll (TC) content, maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) and photon yield of PSII (ΦPSII) in plants grown under without biofertilizer of plot I (TS) were lower than those in biofertilizer treated plants by 8.04, 24.35 and 21.38%, respectively, resulting in declined net photosynthetic rate (Pn) (49.58%) and banana finger weight (38.48%). In contrast, the physiological, morphological characters and yield of banana were maintained in plot II (GF) and plot III (SE). Pn was significantly dropped in plots without treatment and acted as a sensitivity indicator for the lack of biofertilizer. In conclusion, optimized organic farming system of banana production can be adopted as precision farming system in Thailand based on the physiological and morphological adaptation without yield loss.\",\n",

To assess the potential impact of UAV technologies efforts were made to identify a suitable UAV system for wild blueberry production and to evaluate its ability to estimate topographical features, blueberry coverage, pest pressures and berry yields. Trimble Navigation's UX5 system was selected due to its image quality, data accuracy, operating ruggedness, versatility and automated data processing capabilities. The UAV and associated GIS technologies examined resulted the provision of: (i) improvements in field boundaries; (ii) identification of blueberry coverage and bare spots; and (iii) generation of topographical maps being obtained in an accurate, precise and efficient manner. The UX5 system was also able to easily document equipment operator challenges and also appeared to have pest scouting potential with goldenrod pressures being easily identified. However, use of the UX5 or similar UAV systems requires pilot training and certification, regulation compliance and expertise with data acquisition, processing and analysis. Despite these challenges, these emerging technologies have the potential to significantly improve field assessment for plant and pest related factors, reduce agrochemical usage, decrease the cost of production and improve the overall sustainability of the wild blueberry production system.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Quantifying soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for soil management, precision agriculture, soil mapping and carbon dynamics research. Inexpensive sensor technologies offer the potential for rapid quantification of SOC in laboratory samples as well as in the field. The objective of this study was to use a commercially-available color sensor to develop SOC prediction models for both dry and moist soils from the Piedmont region of South Carolina. Thirty-one soil samples were analyzed for lightness to darkness, redness to greenness, and yellowness to blueness (CIEL*a*b*) color using a Nix Pro™ color sensor. Soil color was measured under both dry and moist soil conditions and the depth of each soil sample was also recorded. Using L*, a*, b* and soil depth for each sample as initial predictors, regression analyses were conducted to develop SOC prediction models for dry and moist soils. The resulting residual plots, root mean squared errors (RMSE), and coefficients of determination (R2) were used to assess model fits for predicting the SOC content of soil. Cross validation was conducted to determine the efficiency of the predictive models and the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) was calculated. The final models included soil depth, L*, and a* as independent variables (dry soils R2=0.7978 and MSPE=0.0819, moist soils R2=0.7254 and MSPE=0.1536). The results suggest that soil color sensors have potential for rapid SOC determination, and soil depth and color are useful in predicting SOC content in soils.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Detailed information about spatial distribution of soil properties is important in ecological modelling, environmental prediction, precision agriculture, and natural resources management, as well as land-use planning. In the present study, a recently developed method called geographically weighted regression (GWR) is applied to predict spatial distribution of soil properties (pH, soil organic matter, available nitrogen, available potassium) based on topographical indicators, climate factors, and geological stratum at a regional scale. In total, 1914 soil samples collected from a depth of 0–20cm were used to calibrate and validate the models. Performances of the GWR models were compared with the traditional, ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression. The results indicated that the GWR models made significant improvements to model performances over OLS regression, based on F-test, coefficient of determination, and corrected Akaike information criterion. GWR models also improved the reliability of the soil–environment relationships by reducing the spatial autocorrelations in model residuals. Meanwhile, the use of GWR models disclosed that the relationships between soil properties and environmental variables were not invariant over space but exhibited significant spatial non-stationarity. Accordingly, the GWR models remarkably improved the prediction accuracies over the corresponding OLS models. The results demonstrated that GWR could serve as a useful tool for digital soil mapping in areas with complex terrain.',\n",

In this paper, we focus on responding to intra-field variability in potato crops and analyse variable rate applications (VRAs). We made an overview of potential VRAs in potato crop management in The Netherlands. We identified 13 potential VRAs in potato, ranging from soil tillage to planting to crop care to selective harvest. We ranked them on availability of ‘proof of concept’ and on-farm test results. For five VRAs, we found test results allowing to make a cost-benefit assessment. These five VRAs were as follows: planting, soil herbicide weed control, N side dress, late blight control and haulm killing. They use one of two types of spatial data: soil maps or biomass index maps. Data on costs and savings of the VRAs showed that the investments in VRAs will pay off under practical conditions in The Netherlands. Savings on pesticide use and N-fertilizer use with the VRAs were on average about 25%, which benefits the environment too. We foresee a slow but gradual adoption of VRAs in potato production. More VRAs will become available given ongoing R&D. The perspectives of VRAs in potatoes are discussed.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'INTRODUCTION: An accurate and reliable detection of soil physicochemical attributes (SPAs) is a difficult and complicated issue in soil science. The SPA may be varied spatially and temporally with the complexity of nature. In the past, SPA detection has been obtained through routine soil chemical and physical laboratory analysis. However, these laboratory methods do not fulfill the rapid requirements. Accordingly, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) can be used to nondestructively detect and characterize soil attributes with superior solution. In the present article, we report a study done through spectral curves in the visible (350–700\\xa0nm) and near-infrared (700–2500\\xa0nm) (VNIR) region of 74 soil specimens which were agglomerated by farming sectors of Phulambri Tehsil of the Aurangabad region of Maharashtra, India. The quantitative analysis of VNIR spectrum was done. RESULTS: The spectra of agglomerated farming soils were acquired by the Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Field spec 4 spectroradiometer. The soil spectra of the VNIR region were preprocessed to get pure spectra which were the input for regression modeling. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was computed to construct the calibration models, which were individually validated for the prediction of SPA from the soil spectrum. The computed model was based on a correlation study between reflected spectra and detected SPA. The detected SPAs were soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), soil organic matter (SOM), pH values, electrical conductivity (EC), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), iron (Fe), sand, silt, and clay. The accuracy of the PLSR model-validated determinant (R²) values were SOC 0.89, N 0.68, SOM 0.93, pH values 0.82, EC 0.89, P 0.98, K 0.82, Fe 0.94, sand 0.98, silt 0.90, and clay 0.69 with root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) 3.51, 4.34, 2.66, 2.12, 4.11, 1.41, 4.22, 1.56, 1.89, 1.97, and 9.91, respectively. According to the experimental results, the VNIR-DRS was better for detection of SPA and produced more accurate predictions for SPA. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the methods examined here offered rapid and novel detection of SPA from reflectance spectroscopy. The outcome of the present research will be apt for precision farming and decision-making.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The development of fast, accurate and low-cost methods to quantify soil attributes is of paramount importance to enable detailed mapping, mainly in tropical regions where there is great variation of the chemical, physical and mineralogical attributes. Therefore, the aims of this paper were (i) to investigate if visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility (MS) can be applied to determine soil attributes at the sandstone-basaltic transition and (ii) evaluate and map their spatial distribution. Calibration models based on VIS-NIR spectroscopy and MS were developed separately for each attribute. Soil samples (0–25 cm depth) were collected at 446 sites, air-dried and passed through a 2-mm sieve and analyzed in the laboratory. To develop models based on soil spectra and laboratory data, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used. Already, the MS-based models were calibrated by linear regression between magnetic and laboratory data. The best prediction accuracy parameters were obtained with MS, later with VIS-NIR and lastly with VIS. The more accurate results between the observed and predicted values were found for iron oxide extracted by dithionite (R² = 0.89, RRMSE = 0.02), clay (R² = 0.85, RRMSE = 0.76) and total carbon (R² = 0.83, RRMSE = 1.18) estimated by MS, revealing that this is a good predictor of key properties of studied soils, even with wide chemical and mineralogical variation. Both tools are very attractive for the strategic planning of land use and occupation, mapping large areas with detailed scale, environmental monitoring and precision agriculture.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The aim of this study was to use geostatistical analysis to evaluate the spatial variation in the detachment force of coffee fruit and coffee yield by variograms and kriging for precision agriculture. This study was conducted at Brejão farm, Três Pontas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The detachment force of green and mature coffee fruit was measured with a prototype dynamometer and georeferenced. The yield data were obtained from manual harvesting and were georeferenced. The data were evaluated by variograms estimated by residual maximum likelihood (REML), which provided a satisfactory approach for modeling all the variables with a small sample size. Spherical and exponential models were fitted, the first provided the better fit to mature fruit detachment force and the latter provided the better fit to coffee yield and green fruit detachment force. They were used to describe the structure and magnitude of spatial variation in the variables studied. Kriged estimates were obtained with the best fitting variogram models and mapped. The statistical and geostatistical analyses enabled us to characterize the spatial variation of the detachment force of green and mature coffee fruit and coffee yield and to visualize the spatial relations among these variables. The precision agriculture techniques used in this paper to collect, map and analyze the variables studied will help coffee farmers to manage their fields. Maps of coffee yield will enable farmers to apply nutrients site-specifically and manage harvesting either manually or mechanically. In addition, maps of detachment force of coffee fruit can enable farmers to harvest coffee selectively by choosing the appropriate places and the right time to start. This will improve the quality of the final product and also increase profits.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Climate represents one of the main limiting factors of production efficiency. Thermal stress events can cause reduced performance, morbidity, and mortality, resulting in significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Environment control in confined animal housing systems is typically based on heat and moisture production rates at predetermined ambient temperature levels measured between 1950 and 1980. This traditional control method can fall short in meeting the true thermal needs of the animals since it does not account for factors now acknowledged as affecting the animal's productive responses to surrounding conditions, such as humidity, drafts, radiation, physiological state, and social interactions. Also, advancements in animal genetics, nutrition, and management practices have led to considerable changes in sensible and latent heat loads of modern livestock buildings. In this context, precision livestock farming technologies (sensors, detectors, cameras, microphones, etc.), enabling the automatic monitoring of environmental, physiological, and behavioural variables, can be used to continuously assess livestock performance and well-being in relation to their environment. An innovative strategy for environment control of livestock buildings could include the analysis of: (i) heat and moisture production rates using the most recent bioenergetic models; (ii) thermal stress through multi-factor animal comfort indices based on some environmental and physiological measurements; and (iii) animal behaviour as a response to changing environmental conditions. This paper presents a critical review of the state of the art of precision environment control of livestock buildings, identifying knowledge gaps, research opportunities, and technical challenges.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Farmers in the semi-arid regions of West Africa face challenges related to poor crop establishment, variable rainfall, low soil fertility and a shortage of labour at times of peak demand. Farmers are generally low on resources. Given these conditions, it is important to develop farming practices that make efficient use of the available resources and reduce risks. Here, we review agricultural intensification in semi-arid West Africa using the principles of precision farming to assess the possibilities they offer. The basic idea is to create a favourable micro-environment in the planting pocket and to ensure timely sowing and weeding. In the context of precision farming in the semi-arid West Africa, this means (1) large seeds are selected, primed and treated with a mix of pesticides/fungicides. Seed priming increases yields in the order of 20 to 30%, while seed treatment increases yields by 15%. (2) Mineral fertilizers are applied; at doses as low as 0.3\\xa0g of fertilizer per pocket, they have been found to increase yields by half or more. (3) Seeds and fertilizers are distributed accurately by means of a combined planter-weeder, which can be motorized. (4) Mechanized sowing and weeding enable timely farm operations and reduce the workload. (5) Water loss is prevented by using zaï and stone bunds on soils with high run-off rates. (6) Care is taken to make use of farm resources in a targeted and efficient way. This can imply adjusting micro-doses of manure and fertilizer to crops (sorghum needs less than millet) and soil types, sequenced sowing of crops according to their vulnerability to delayed sowing and applying organic input to soils. This paper is the first to review agricultural intensification in semi-arid West Africa within the context of precision farming. It shows how a low-cost package for precision farming can be developed, which can help to increase land and labour productivity, and works with all the major field crops in the region.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) and soil moisture deficit (SMD) are vital for understanding the hydrological processes, particularly in the context of sustainable water use efficiency in the globe. Precise estimation of ETo and SMD are required for developing appropriate forecasting systems, in hydrological modeling and also in precision agriculture. In this study, the surface temperature downscaled from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to estimate ETo using the boundary conditions that are provided by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). In order to understand the performance, the Hamon’s method is employed to estimate the ETo using the temperature from meteorological station and WRF derived variables. After estimating the ETo, a range of linear and non-linear models is utilized to retrieve SMD. The performance statistics such as RMSE, %Bias, and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) indicates that the exponential model (RMSE = 0.226; %Bias = −0.077; NSE = 0.616) is efficient for SMD estimation by using the Observed ETo in comparison to the other linear and non-linear models (RMSE range = 0.019–0.667; %Bias range = 2.821–6.894; NSE = 0.013–0.419) used in this study. On the other hand, in the scenario where SMD is estimated using WRF downscaled meteorological variables based ETo, the linear model is found promising (RMSE = 0.017; %Bias = 5.280; NSE = 0.448) as compared to the non-linear models (RMSE range = 0.022–0.707; %Bias range = −0.207–−6.088; NSE range = 0.013–0.149). Our findings also suggest that all the models are performing better during the growing season (RMSE range = 0.024–0.025; %Bias range = −4.982–−3.431; r = 0.245–0.281) than the non−growing season (RMSE range = 0.011–0.12; %Bias range = 33.073–32.701; r = 0.161–0.244) for SMD estimation.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Soil organic carbon stock plays a key role in the global carbon cycle and the precision agriculture. Visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) can directly reflect the internal physical construction and chemical substances of soil. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) is a classical and highly commonly used model in constructing soil spectral models and predicting soil properties. Nevertheless, using PLSR alone may not consider soil as characterized by strong spatial heterogeneity and dependence. However, considering the spatial characteristics of soil can offer valuable spatial information to guarantee the prediction accuracy of soil spectral models. Thus, this study aims to construct a rapid and accurate soil spectral model in predicting soil organic carbon density (SOCD) with the aid of the spatial autocorrelation of soil spectral reflectance. A total of 231 topsoil samples (0–30 cm) were collected from the Jianghan Plain, Wuhan, China. The spectral reflectance (350–2500 nm) was used as auxiliary variable. A geographically-weighted regression (GWR) model was used to evaluate the potential improvement of SOCD prediction when the spatial information of the spectral features was considered. Results showed that: (1) The principal components extracted from PLSR have a strong relationship with the regression coefficients at the average sampling distance (300 m) based on the Moran’s I values. (2) The eigenvectors of the principal components exhibited strong relationships with the absorption spectral features, and the regression coefficients of GWR varied with the geographical locations. (3) GWR displayed a higher accuracy than that of PLSR in predicting the SOCD by VNIRS. This study aimed to help people realize the importance of the spatial characteristics of soil properties and their spectra. This work also introduced guidelines for the application of GWR in predicting soil properties by VNIRS.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Near-ground geophysical soil sensors provide valuable information for precision agriculture applications. Indeed, their readings can be used as proxy for many soil parameters. On-the-go soil sensor surveys are, typically, carried out intensively (e.g., every 2m) over many parallel transects. Two types of soil sensors measurements are considered in this paper: apparent electrical conductivity (4 fields in California, USA) and reflectance (1 field in Italy). Two types of spatial interpolations are carried out, universal kriging (model-based) and inverse distance weighting (deterministic). Interpolation quality assessment is usually carried out using leave-one-out (loo) resampling. We show that loo resampling on transect sampling datasets returns overly-optimistic, low interpolation errors, because the left-out data point has values very close to that of its neighbors in the training dataset. This bias in the map quality assessment can be reduced by removing the closest neighbors of the validation observation from the training dataset, in a (spatial) h-block (SHB) fashion. The results indicate that, for soil sensor data acquired along parallel transects: (i) the SHB resampling is a useful tool to test the performance of interpolation techniques and (ii) the optimal (i.e., rendering the same errors of un-sampled locations between transects) SHB threshold distance (h.dist) for neighbor-exclusion is proportional to the semi-variogram range and partial sill. This procedure provides research scientists with an improved means of understanding the error of soil maps made by interpolating soil sensor measurements.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Near-ground geophysical soil sensors provide valuable information for precision agriculture applications. Indeed, their readings can be used as proxy for many soil parameters. On-the-go soil sensor surveys are, typically, carried out intensively (e.g., every 2m) over many parallel transects. Two types of soil sensors measurements are considered in this paper: apparent electrical conductivity (4 fields in California, USA) and reflectance (1 field in Italy). Two types of spatial interpolations are carried out, universal kriging (model-based) and inverse distance weighting (deterministic). Interpolation quality assessment is usually carried out using leave-one-out (loo) resampling. We show that loo resampling on transect sampling datasets returns overly-optimistic, low interpolation errors, because the left-out data point has values very close to that of its neighbors in the training dataset. This bias in the map quality assessment can be reduced by removing the closest neighbors of the validation observation from the training dataset, in a (spatial) h-block (SHB) fashion. The results indicate that, for soil sensor data acquired along parallel transects: (i) the SHB resampling is a useful tool to test the performance of interpolation techniques and (ii) the optimal (i.e., rendering the same errors of un-sampled locations between transects) SHB threshold distance (h.dist) for neighbor-exclusion is proportional to the semi-variogram range and partial sill. This procedure provides research scientists with an improved means of understanding the error of soil maps made by interpolating soil sensor measurements.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The objective of this review is to present, evaluate and discuss methods for reducing false alarms in sensor-based detection models developed for livestock production as described in the scientific literature. Papers included in this review are all peer-reviewed and present sensor-based detection models developed for modern livestock production with the purpose of optimizing animal health or managerial routines. The papers must present a performance for the model, but no criteria were specified for animal species or the condition sought to be detected. 34 papers published during the last 20years (1995–2015) are presented in three groups according to their level of prioritization: “Sheer detection models” based on single-standing methods with or without inclusion of non-sensor-based information (19 papers), “Improved detection models” where the performance of the described models are sought to be improved through the combination of different methods (12 papers) and “Prioritizing models” where the models include a method of ranking or prioritizing alerts in order to reduce the number of false alarms (3 papers). Of the three methods that rank or prioritize alerts; Fuzzy Logic, Naive Bayesian Network (NBN) and Hidden phase-type Markov model, the NBN shows the greatest potential for future reduction of alerts from sensor-based detection models in livestock production. The included detection models are evaluated on three criteria; performance, time-window and similarity to determine whether they are suitable for implementation in modern livestock production herds. No model fulfills all three criteria and only three models meet the performance criterion. Reasons for this could be that both sensor technology and methods for developing the detection models have evolved over time. However, model performance is almost exclusively presented by the binary epidemiological terms Sensitivity (Se) and Specificity (Sp). It is suggested that future research focus on alternative approaches for the output of detection models, such as the prior probability or the risk of a condition occurring. Automatic monitoring and early warning systems offer an opportunity to observe certain aspects of animal health, welfare, and productivity more closely than traditionally accomplished through human observation, and the opportunities for improving animal welfare should continue to be a driving force throughout the field of precision livestock farming.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The goal of this study was to evaluate different strategies for defining homogeneous zones, and to verify their usefulness by comparing soil moisture contents and crop yields. Data were obtained from a field experiment near General Pico, La Pampa, Argentina, with a sampling grid of 598 points. Soil texture, organic matter, available phosphorus, pH, and electrical conductivity were determined. Altimetry was obtained by a GPS (Garmin 19X). Corn yields and available soil moisture contents were determined in a 184 point grid. Treatments were early and late planting date, and control and 100kgNha−1. MULTISPATI-PCA was used to carry out for multivariate spatial analyses of soil attributes. The synthetic variables (sPC) were analyzed, mapped and used for determination of homogeneous zones by three strategies: S1-natural rupture method on sPC1, S2-Fuzzy k-means cluster analysis on soil variables and S3-Fuzzy k-means cluster analysis on all sPC. Zones were compared for means of soil variables, available soil water and maize yields. The three tested statistical strategies divided the field in a very similar manner when the minimum number of zones was considered, with coincidence in the classification of 98% of the sampled grid points. The different strategies resulted in different number of zones with different characteristics. The choice of the method depends on the objectives for determination of management zones. In our case, for fertilization management zonification might prioritize the differentiation of OM and available P contents and use S3, while if water was the main limiting factor, the management zones would be two according to S1 or S2, responding to textural and altimetry differences.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Gamma spectrometric field measurements may provide high resolution information on topsoil texture. Yet, calibrations for the estimation of texture data usually have to be done site-specifically. The lack of site-independent calibrations thus limits the easy and universal use of proximal gamma-ray sensing in soil mapping and precision agriculture. Our objective was to develop a study site-independent prediction model for topsoil texture from gamma-ray spectra. We surveyed ten study sites across Germany with 417 reference samples (291 for calibration, 126 for test set-validation), providing soils from a broad range of parent materials and with widely varying soil texture. First, study site-specific models were calibrated by a linear regression approach. These models provided reliable estimations of sand, silt, and clay for most of the study sites. Second, study site-independent models were calibrated via i) linear regression and ii) support vector machines (SVM), the latter being mathematical methods of data pattern recognition. Based on the non-linear relationship between gamma spectrum and soil texture, which varied widely between the different parent materials the linear models are not appropriate for satisfactory soil texture prediction (averaged R2 of 0.73 for sand, 0.61 for silt, and 0.18 for clay and averaged absolute prediction errors of 9 to 5%, respectively). In contrast, the SVM calibrated prediction models revealed reliable performance also for site-independent calibrations. With the non-linear SVM approach we were able to include all sites in one single prediction model for each texture fraction although the different mineralogical composition of their parent materials led to complex and partly opposing relationships between gamma features and soil texture. Site-independent predictions via SVM were often even better than site-specific linear regression models. The site-independent SVM calibrated predictions yielded an averaged R2 of 0.96 (sand), 0.93 (silt), and 0.78 (clay), and corresponding averaged absolute prediction errors of 2 to 4%, respectively. To summarize, (i) non-linear prediction models are a feasible approach for capable site-independent texture estimations across a wide range of soils and (ii) gamma spectrometry-based texture predictions are a valuable input for applications that require highly resolved texture information at low costs and efforts.',\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the field-scale spatial variability of SOC under five prevalent land use and land cover (LULC) types in Florida, U.S. with a uniform sampling scheme. Five scales, 2, 7, 22, 67 and>200m, were targeted and 108 soil samples at 0–20cm depth were collected and analyzed for SOC and bulk densities within each LULC type in 2012. Results indicate that SOC variability was scale dependent. Hardwood Hammock and Forest and Improved Pasture demonstrated large variation at both coarse scale (67 and>200m) and very fine scale (2m). Sandhill, Pineland and Dry Prairie were dominated by variation at very fine scales (2 and 7m). All five sites showed large variability at very fine scales, indicating the close coupling of SOC stock variation to structure and composition of vegetation. This study also identified that log-transformed SOC showed variance-invariant behavior, which had an approximately constant overall variance (sill) of 0.067±0.012 (log(kgm−2))2at field scale (∼500m) irrespective of LULC. These findings serve to explain field-scale variability of SOC relevant for precision agriculture and land management, but also facilitate better understanding of the scale-dependent fine-scale variability of SOC across larger soilscapes.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A compact variable rate sprayer for use in teaching precision agriculture was developed and field tested. A 3.57-m (11.7-ft) boom-type field sprayer with a 227-L (60-gal) tank was used as the base unit. Off-the-shelf Global Positioning System and variable rate application components were modified as necessary and installed on the base unit. The cost of the completed variable rate sprayer was approximately $9700. For field testing, a 12.8-m (42-ft) wide x 91.4-m (300-ft) long test course was laid out and spraying prescriptions were written for field speeds of 2.74 and 5.47 km/h (1.7 and 3.4 mph). With a 2-s delay programmed into the unit, the mean position error was 0.37 m (1.23 ft) at 2.74 km/h (1.7 mph) and 0.77 m (2.51 ft) at 5.47 km/h (3.4 mph). Once the sprayer traveled into a prescribed spray zone, a mean distance of from 0.87 m (2.85 ft) (for low speed, low application rate) to 3.53 m (11.58 ft) (for high speed, high application rate) was traveled before the sprayer output initially reached the prescribed rate. The sprayer output stabilized at the prescribed rate at a mean distance of 9.59 m (31.45 ft) (high speed, high application rate) to 13.61 m (44.64 ft) (low speed, low application rate). The variable rate sprayer will be used in undergraduate and graduate classes and in workshops for agriculture teachers, Extension agents, and producers.',\n",

A good sensor model allows accurate prediction of environmental variables even with incomplete sensor data and provides basis to assess the quality of sensor readings. We investigate a clustered sensor model using observations of nearby sensors. The proposed method uses a cluster of self-evolving sub-models to model the dynamic and correlation between the networked field sensors. Each cluster represents a set of closely-related sensor attributes. The model is shown to produce accurate sensor prediction when proper attributes are selected during model training. The clustered sensor model is evaluated using field data collected in a high tunnel greenhouse. Our experiment data indicate that correlation of sensor attributes can be identified from training data and significantly improve prediction accuracy with the presence of faulty sensor data.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The loss of weed biodiversity in agricultural fields is a global issue that needs to be counteracted to preserve their supported ecosystem services and food webs. Many short-term efforts are undertaken to conserve weed species, especially already endangered ones, but several years after expiration, eventually result in species-poor communities. Understanding drivers of community composition is key to prevent biodiversity loss. To understand the factors that shape weed communities and influence weed diversity and endangered weed species, we monitored conventional and organic cereal fields in two regions of southwestern Germany. A redundancy analysis was performed on vegetation recordings and data from a farmer survey. Crop species, herbicide use, farming system, nitrogen, and light availability had the strongest impact on weed diversity. The weed communities were dominated by Alopecurus myosuroides, Galium aparine, Viola arvensis, Polygonum convolvulus, and Veronica persica, and were mainly shaped by crop species, tillage, location in the field, and timing of herbicide application. Bromus grossus and Bromus secalinus, two endangered weed species, survived in conventional field margins as a result of the use of herbicides with gaps for Bromus species. Conservation efforts are not restricted to organic farming and should consider the major drivers of weed communities. Precision farming techniques are available to create networks of habitats for endangered and common weed species and subsequently increase agro-biodiversity per se.',\n",

Major issues in the implementation of PA include interpreting the huge amount of data collected, understanding the causes of variability, and being able to propose sound strategies for field variability management. To help address these issues, a software infrastructure is proposed. It adopts concepts from software engineering with the aim of providing a basis for the development of information systems for PA based on open platforms, and on data communication and software interoperability standards. The infrastructure has two main components and a reference architecture for the development of distributed service-oriented systems.

       "   'abstract': 'Homegardens or “solares” have a long history of intensive cultivation by the Maya in southeastern Mexico and Central America, and have recently been the subject of increasing studies that characterize them as “multistrata agroforestry systems”, although no soil evaluation has been reported. We have conducted this study in a traditional homegarden named “El Naranjal”, a rural village in the north of Quintana Roo, Mexico, in order to evaluate soil date and quality from this specific site, being the soil the main factor of this traditional Maya agroforestry management system. The ¹⁴C analysis of the A₁ horizon humic fraction, from the deepest soil profile exposed in a karstic depression, gave a date that corresponds with the occupation of the site at the Maya peak of the mayan possession from the Late Preclassic to Early Classic transition, beginning about 100 B.C. The soils found (Rendzic Leptosols) into El Naranjal homegarden are well structured, very dark brown, shallow, and have an abrupt contact with the limestone bedrock at a highly variable depth. According to this fact, soil depth showed along the studied transect, the highest variation (variation coefficient=72%) compared to Ranch Santa Maria (VC=46.3%) and El Eden (43%) soils, being sites with similar heterogeneity degrees. The pH values ranged from neutral to moderately basic (7.10–8.00); this parameter that influences the humification and mineralization processes, showed a low VC (3.37%). Organic matter content varied from high to very high (7.30–20.23%, at 30–80cm deep, and ranged in the deepest soil profiles from 2.00% to 3.98%). High levels of P retention (21.5–83.0%) were found; this characteristic is related to high values of exchangeable Ca²⁺ and dithionite-extractable Fe, present in all studied profiles. The soils are clayish and have middle to high values of hydraulic conductivity (4.8–64.8cmh⁻¹) that displayed a high VC (65.74%). The values of the “S” index (soil physical quality index) fluctuated between 0.059 and 0.068, indicating good physical soil quality, with regard to the proposed critical value of 0.035. According to other physical and chemical properties, it was found that the soils from this homegarden have favorable qualities for air transport, heat, water and soluble substances. The iron oxides and organic components are responsible for soil color, high aggregation with good stability and consequently of their high porosity. But, on the other hand, the highly variable soil depth (often insufficient for the development of root systems) and the large level of P retention (phosphorus-fixing capacity) are the most obvious physical and chemical disadvantages to crop growth. These are also the most common and restrictive factors in many soils from the Yucatán Peninsula. However, results showed that the cultivation system, successfully employed in the homegarden, uses an uncommon edaphic environment. This occurs through a traditional crop adaptation to particular areas of thicker soils (“containers”), known traditionally as “precision agriculture”.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Continuous paddy rice cultivation requires fields to be flooded most of the time limiting seriously the collection of detailed soil information. So far, no appropriate soil sensor technology for identifying soil variability of flooded fields has been reported. Therefore, the primary objective was the development of a sensing system that can float, acquire and process detailed geo-referenced soil information within flooded fields. An additional objective was to determine whether the collected apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) information could be used to support soil management at a within-field level. A floating sensing system (FloSSy) was built to record ECa using the electromagnetic induction sensor EM38, which does not require physical contact with the soil. Its feasibility was tested in an alluvial paddy field of 2.7\\xa0ha located in the Brahmaputra floodplain of Bangladesh. The high-resolution (1\\xa0×\\xa01\\xa0m) ECa data were classified into three classes using the fuzzy k-means classification method. The variation among the classes could be attributed to differences in subsoil (0.15–0.30\\xa0m below soil surface) bulk density, with the smallest ECa values representing the lowest bulk density. This effect was attributed to differences in compaction of the plough pan due to differential puddling. There was also a significant difference in rice yield among the ECa classes, with the smallest ECa values representing the lowest yield. It was concluded that the floating sensing system allowed the collection of relevant soil information, opening potential for precision agriculture practices in flooded crop fields.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'As an important topographic attribute widely-used in precision agriculture, topographic wetness index (TWI) is designed to quantify the effect of local topography on hydrological processes and for modeling the spatial distribution of soil moisture and surface saturation. This index is formulated as TWI = ln(a/tanβ), where a is the upslope contributing area per unit contour length (or Specific Catchment Area, SCA) and tanβ is the local slope gradient for estimating a hydraulic gradient. The computation of both a and tanβ need to reflect impacts of local terrain on local drainage. Many of the existing flow direction algorithms for computing a use global parameters, which lead to unrealistic partitioning of flow. β is often approximated by slope gradient around the pixel. In fact, the downslope gradient of the pixel is a better approximation of β. This paper examines how TWI is impacted by a multiple flow routing algorithm adaptive to local terrain and the employment of maximum downslope gradient as β. The adaptive multiple flow routing algorithm partitions flow by altering the flow partition parameter based on local maximum downslope gradient. The proposed approach for computing TWI is quantitatively evaluated using four types of artificial terrains constructed as DEMs with a series of resolutions (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m), respectively. The result shows that the error of TWI computed using the proposed approach is generally lower than that of TWI by the widely used approach. The new approach was applied to a low-relief agricultural catchment (about 60 km²) in the Nenjiang watershed, Northeastern China. The results of this application show that the distribution of TWI by the proposed approach reflects local terrain conditions better.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Imaging spectroscopy is widely used in weed recognition, pest monitoring, agricultural product quality control and other precision agricultural fields. In the present study, an in-house-designed/developed field imaging spectroscopy system (FISS, 380–870\\xa0nm) was used to obtain the imaging spectra of soybean leaves at 344 wavelengths. The spatial and spectral information including the entropy, mean reflectivity and standard deviation of the leaf images at different wavelengths were extracted; the chlorophyll content was retrieved using multiple linear regression (MLR) together with the spatial information and spectral information, and the results were compared with the results derived with the Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD, FieldSpecFR spectrometer, Analytical Spectral Devices Inc., USA) data that were generated using conventional single sensor spectrometers. The results demonstrated that the entropy, standard deviation and other features of the image were very good indicators of the leaf chlorophyll content, confirming the idea that spatial information can be used to retrieve chlorophyll content, with an accuracy equivalent to that of spectral information, and can provide information that spectral reflectivity cannot provide. Thus, integrating spatial information and spectral information can greatly improve the chlorophyll content retrieval accuracy and reduce the estimation errors by 20\\xa0%. Due to the unique measurement method and image-spectrum-in-one feature, the field imaging spectroscopy system (FISS) data can be conveniently used to achieve accurate chlorophyll content retrieval, and the retrieval error was reduced by 30–45\\xa0% compared with that for the ASD data. FISS data and the proposed method of integrating both spectral and spatial information of imaging spectroscopy have potential advantages in quantitative spectral analysis applied in agricultural biochemistry related fields.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Maps of kriged soil properties for precision agriculture are often based on a variogram estimated from too few data because the costs of sampling and analysis are often prohibitive. If the variogram has been computed by the usual method of moments, it is likely to be unstable when there are fewer than 100 data. The scale of variation in soil properties should be investigated prior to sampling by computing a variogram from ancillary data, such as an aerial photograph of the bare soil. If the sampling interval suggested by this is large in relation to the size of the field there will be too few data to estimate a reliable variogram for kriging. Standardized variograms from aerial photographs can be used with standardized soil data that are sparse, provided the data are spatially structured and the nugget:sill ratio is similar to that of a reliable variogram of the property. The problem remains of how to set this ratio in the absence of an accurate variogram. Several methods of estimating the nugget:sill ratio for selected soil properties are proposed and evaluated. Standardized variograms with nugget:sill ratios set by these methods are more similar to those computed from intensive soil data than are variograms computed from sparse soil data. The results of cross-validation and mapping show that the standardized variograms provide more accurate estimates, and preserve the main patterns of variation better than those computed from sparse data.',\n",

In this context, integrated pest management aims to suppress pest populations below an action threshold to minimize their impact. This paper presents the development of a web tool based on the Spanish regulations for the integrated pest management of table grapes; this provides decision support for evaluating when a particular pest action threshold has been crossed thus affecting table grape crops. The tool was built using a model-driven software development approach that enables software system generation from the problem’s knowledge model. The design of the knowledge bases which contain the system’s decision rules is also described. It is divided into knowledge bases that contain general knowledge related to the table grape crop as well as several specific knowledge bases (one per pest) containing the reasoning model that deduces the risk associated with a particular pest. The software has been designed by applying the model-driven development method thus making the system flexible, easy to evolve and adaptable whenever a new pest has to be incorporated into the software.',\n",

An algorithm was also developed for prediction of fruit mass per plant based on the ultrasonic echo return from a plant. The ultrasonic sensor system was tested in lab and pepper greenhouse environments and on single pepper plants, single leaves and fruit. The results showed the potential of ultrasonic sensors for such a robot in classifying plants and greenhouse infrastructures such as walls. It showed the robot’s ability to detect hidden plant rows and fruits as well as making an estimation of the fruit mass in single plants. A multi-linear regression model developed for estimating the energy level was found to be highly significant with R ² of 0.64 and 0.84 for 28–32 and 20–28\\xa0kHz ranges respectively. This estimated model was used to derive a prediction method for fruit mass per plant that yielded an R² of 0.34.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'To overcome the limited transmission range of spatially separated nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN), a small 4-wheel autonomous robot assembled the data from nodes distributed in a vineyard. First, the robot followed a predefined way-point route between the grapevine rows, in order to evaluate the sensor node locations by their received signal strength indication (RSSI). Then, the recorded and geo-referenced RSSI data were analysed and mapped. By using the evaluated node positions, an optimised second route was generated. While navigating, a laser scanner was used for obstacle detection and avoidance. Path planning with known positions of the nodes reduced the driving time by 15 times compared with the first run, because the hybrid control system used was capable of navigating within the plantation even perpendicular to the row structures. For locating the nodes, results based on trilateration were compared with the values of an attached differential global navigation satellite system (DGNSS). The results showed that it is possible to locate and geo-reference the sensor nodes with a robot, even without any prior knowledge about their absolute position. The best achieved location showed a deviation with DGNSS of 1.2\\xa0m and with RSSI trilateration of 0.6\\xa0m compared to the actual position.',\n",

In this study, the case of simultaneous occurrence of yellow rust disease symptoms and nitrogen stress was investigated by using hyperspectral features from a ground based hyperspectral imaging system. Hyperspectral images of healthy and diseased plant canopies were taken at Rothamsted Research, UK by a Specim V10 spectrograph. Five wavebands of 20\\xa0nm width were utilized for accurate identification of each of the stress and healthy plant conditions. The technique that was developed used a hybrid classification scheme consisting of hierarchical self organizing classifiers. Three different architectures were considered: counter-propagation artificial neural networks, supervised Kohonen networks (SKNs) and XY-fusion. A total of 12\\xa0120 spectra were collected. From these 3\\xa0062 (25.3%) were used for testing. The results of biotic and abiotic stress identification appear to be promising, reaching more than 95% for all three architectures. The proposed approach aimed at sensor based detection of diseased and stressed plants so that can be treated site specifically contributing to a more effective and precise application of fertilizers and fungicides according to specific plant’s needs.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The availability of irrigation water is one of the main concerns in Mediterranean agriculture. For this reason, it is so important to accurately determine the water needs of the crop in order to optimize the use of scarce water resources. This paper presents the design and operation validation of an agroclimatic data acquisition system composed of a set of wireless nodes with different functionalities to ascertain irrigation requirements based on weather and lysimetric data. These nodes were based on a common single-board computer to which, depending on the required features, additional hardware components were added. A comparative study of the different single-board computers available in the market was conducted and the Raspberry Pi device was selected due its high performance to cost ratio. With this philosophy, the design of two types of nodes was proposed: climate nodes and lysimetric nodes. Software drivers were developed for both to perform data acquisition and to send the measurements through a mobile network to an application hosted in the cloud. This application managed the storage of the data in a structured-relational database. The required interfaces were programmed to allow the user to view historical and real-time data, as well as configure additional parameters of the nodes related to the crop, geographical location and so on. This cloud application is accessible from any computer or mobile device with an internet connection. All the software tools and hardware platforms were low-cost and open source. Various performance tests were carried out both in the laboratory and in the field, obtaining evapotranspiration measurements consistent with the reference evapotranspiration calculated from data of the climate node.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Understanding of soil spatial variability is needed to delimit areas for precision agriculture. Electromagnetic induction sensors which measure the soil apparent electrical conductivity reflect soil spatial variability. The objectives of this work were to see if a temporally stable component could be found in electrical conductivity, and to see if temporal stability information acquired from several electrical conductivity surveys could be used to better interpret the results of concurrent surveys of electrical conductivity and soil water content. The experimental work was performed in a commercial rainfed olive grove of 6.7 ha in the ‘La Manga’ catchment in SW Spain. Several soil surveys provided gravimetric soil water content and electrical conductivity data. Soil electrical conductivity values were used to spatially delimit three areas in the grove, based on the first principal component, which represented the time-stable dominant spatial electrical conductivity pattern and explained 86% of the total electrical conductivity variance. Significant differences in clay, stone and soil water contents were detected between the three areas. Relationships between electrical conductivity and soil water content were modelled with an exponential model. Parameters from the model showed a strong effect of the first principal component on the relationship between soil water content and electrical conductivity. Overall temporal stability of electrical conductivity reflects soil properties and manifests itself in spatial patterns of soil water content.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Precision nitrogen (N) management for corn has gained popularity due to both economic and environmental considerations. There is sufficient evidence demonstrating that N fertilizer efficiency can be improved by implementing sidedress and variable rate fertilization. In this paper, a crop model- and satellite imagery-based decision-support tool for recommending variable rate N fertilization at a high resolution of 5\\xa0m\\xa0×\\xa05\\xa0m is introduced. The sub-field management zones were delineated by overlapping the soil survey geographic (SSURGO) soil map units with wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI)-derived relative productivity zones. The calibrated Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) was used to simulate a range of soil N processes, corn growth and N uptake by assimilating real-time weather data from the National Climate Data Center (NCDC). Sidedress N rates were estimated based on the target rate, N loss via leaching and denitrification, plant uptake and leftover N in the soil. The tool was tested on a 66\\xa0ha corn field in Illinois, USA for the growing season of 2015. Results showed that N-Prescription was able to give reasonable management zone delineation and sidedress N recommendation. The recommended sidedress N ranged from 60 to over 120\\xa0kg\\xa0ha⁻¹. Corn yield was greater in areas with higher sidedress recommendation, but the benefit from sidedress decreased with the increasing rate and plateaued above 110\\xa0kg\\xa0ha⁻¹. Sensitivity analysis suggested that soil hydraulic properties and soil organic matter content were critical to the sidedress accounting. Corn growth, and hence the cumulative N uptake, can be well simulated by calibrating the WDRVI derived leaf area index. This tool could serve as a good foundation for further development in precision N management.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Machine vision technologies hold the promise of enabling rapid and accurate fruit crop yield predictions in the field. The key to fulfilling this promise is accurate segmentation and detection of fruit in images of tree canopies. This paper proposes two new methods for automated counting of fruit in images of mango tree canopies, one using texture-based dense segmentation and one using shape-based fruit detection, and compares the use of these methods relative to existing techniques:—(i) a method based on K-nearest neighbour pixel classification and contour segmentation, and (ii) a method based on super-pixel over-segmentation and classification using support vector machines. The robustness of each algorithm was tested on multiple sets of images of mango trees acquired over a period of 3\\xa0years. These image sets were acquired under varying conditions (light and exposure), distance to the tree, average number of fruit on the tree, orchard and season. For images collected under the same conditions as the calibration images, estimated fruit numbers were within 16\\xa0% of actual fruit numbers, and the F1 measure of detection performance was above 0.68 for these methods. Results were poorer when models were used for estimating fruit numbers in trees of different canopy shape and when different imaging conditions were used. For fruit-background segmentation, K-nearest neighbour pixel classification based on colour and smoothness or pixel classification based on super-pixel over-segmentation, clustering of dense scale invariant feature transform features into visual words and bag-of-visual-word super-pixel classification using support vector machines was more effective than simple contrast and colour based segmentation. Pixel classification was best followed by fruit detection using an elliptical shape model or blob detection using colour filtering and morphological image processing techniques. Method results were also compared using precision–recall plots. Imaging at night under artificial illumination with careful attention to maintaining constant illumination conditions is highly recommended.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Source to sink size ratio, i.e.: the relative abundance of photosynthetically active organs (leaves) with regards to photosynthate demanding organs (mainly bunches), is widely known to be one of the main drivers of grape oenological quality. However, due to the difficulty of remote sink size estimation, Precision Viticulture (PV) has been mainly based on within-field zone delineation using vegetation indices. This approach has given only moderately satisfactory results for discriminating zones with differential quality. The aim of this work was to investigate an approach to delineate within-vineyard quality zones that includes an estimator of sink size in the data-set. The study was carried out during two consecutive seasons on a 4.2\\xa0ha gobelet-trained cv. ‘Tempranillo’ vineyard. Zone delineation was performed using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECₐ) and bunch number (BN) data. These variables were considered separately, in pairs, or the three altogether, using fuzzy k-means cluster analysis for combinations. The zones delineated based on single variables did not allow a sufficient discrimination for grape composition at harvest, NDVI being the only variable that by itself resulted in zones that to some extent differed in grape composition. On the contrary, when two variables were combined, discrimination in terms of grape composition improved remarkably, provided the sink size estimation variable (BN) was included in the combination. Lastly, the combination of the three variables yielded the best discriminating zoning, improving slightly on those provided by NDVI\\xa0+\\xa0BN and ECₐ\\xa0+\\xa0BN combinations. Thus, the relevance of including a variable related to sink size (in this case the number of bunches per plant) has been confirmed, which makes its consideration highly advisable for any PV work aiming at zone delineation for grape quality purposes.',\n",

These systems consist of a group of detection–action devices which manage the spraying. In this work, the technical feasibility of a low-cost ultrasound detection system prototype has been assessed for pesticide spray application on greenhouse crops. The prototype is based on a commercially-available car parking assistance system, which has been modified to amplify the signal and activate an electro-valve for spray control. This system was fitted into a self-propelled machine with two vertical spray booms. A laboratory test was carried out to evaluate the system limitations (detection range, response time, optimal sensor location); and once the feasibility of the system was known, a field test was conducted. Inside the greenhouse, the same parameters were determined for canopy presence. The system’s capacity to start and stop spraying at the beginnings and ends of the crop lines was also analysed. In addition, the minimum crop line surface with no plant mass that triggers system activation was determined. The results show that the detection range was 0–0.4\\xa0m with an average response time of 1.67\\xa0s. Based on these parameters, the optimal sensor location was determined for the different forward velocities. In conclusion, the results show that this system is suitable for plant detection at a forward speed of 0.9\\xa0m\\xa0s⁻¹, allowing growers to stop spraying automatically at the ends of the crop lines and where plant mass absence is greater than 1.0 lineal meter.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Currently, sugar snap peas are harvested manually. In high-cost countries like Norway, such a labour-intensive practise implies particularly large costs for the farmer. Hence, automated alternatives are highly sought after. This project explored a concept for robotic autonomous identification and tracking of sugar snap pea pods. The approach was based on a combination of visible–near infrared reflection measurements and image analysis, along with visual servoing. A proof-of-concept harvesting platform was implemented by mounting a robotic arm with hand-mounted sensors on a mobile unit. The platform was tested under plastic greenhouse conditions on potted plants of the sugar snap pea variety Cascadia using LED-lights and a partial shade. The results showed that it was feasible to differentiate the pods from the surrounding foliage using the light reflection at the spectral range around 970\\xa0nm combined with elementary image segmentation and shape modelling methods. The proof-of-concept harvesting platform was tested on 48 representative agricultural environments comprising dense canopy, varying pod sizes, partial occlusions and different working distances. A set of 104 images were analysed during the teleoperation experiment. The true positive detection rate was 93 and 87% for images acquired at long distances and at close distances, respectively. The robot arm achieved a success rate of 54% for autonomous visual servoing to a pre-grasp pose around targeted pods on 22 untouched scenarios. This study shows the potential of developing a prototype robot for semi-automated sugar snap pea harvesting.',\n",
