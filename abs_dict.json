A minimum basic sanitation facility should enable safe and appropriate removal of human waste, and although pit latrines provide this, they are still contamination concerns. Pit latrine sludge in SA is mostly emptied and disposed off-site as waste or buried in-situ. Despite having knowledge of potential sludge benefits, most communities in SA are reluctant to use it. This research captured social perceptions regarding latrine sludge management in Monontsha village in the Free State Province of SA through key informant interviews and questionnaires. A key informant interview and questionnaire was done in Monontsha, SA. Eighty participants, representing 5% of all households, were selected. Water samples from four boreholes and four rivers were analyzed for faecal coliforms and E.coli bacteria. On average, five people in a household were sharing a pit latrine. Eighty-three percent disposed filled pit latrines while 17% resorted to closing the filled latrines. Outbreaks of diarrhoea (69%) and cholera (14%) were common. Sixty percent were willing to use treated faecal sludge in agriculture. The binary logistic regression model indicated that predictor variables significantly (p \u02c2 0.05) described water quality, faecal sludge management, sludge application in agriculture and biochar adaption. Most drinking water sources in the study had detections \u02c2 1 CFU/100 mL. It is therefore imperative to use both qualitative surveys and analytical data. Awareness can go a long way to motivate individuals to adopt to a new change.

To this end, data from 300 randomly selected farm households from Pakistan were collected through a structured self-report questionnaire. Using logistic regression (LR) and structural equation modeling (SEM), socioeconomic and psychosocial effects were evaluated. The results show that economic status, watching agricultural training programs, newspaper and radio awareness campaigns, participation in extension programs, perceptions of sustainable agriculture and the feasibility of SAPs were significant factors in farmers\u2019 adoption of sustainable agriculture practices. Also, consistent with the theory of planned behavior (TPB), all its dimensions (attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control) affected the adoption of SAPs. This finding highlights the importance of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors in promoting sustainable agricultural practice among banana production farmers. This is the first study which attempts to provide empirical evidence using a robust procedure (two models\u2014LR and SEM). The practical implication is that, when socioeconomic and psychosocial factors are well supported by satisfactory policy measures, SAP adoption is more than likely, which eventually increases farmers\u2019 adaptive capacity to the changing environment. Ultimately, this leads to sustainable banana production, which has great potential to contribute towards poverty eradication.

HMM, such as lead and arsenic, can result in adverse health effects for humans. Gardeners may face exposure to these contaminants because of their regular contact with soil and consumption of produce grown in urban areas. However, there is a lack of research regarding whether differential exposure to HMM may be attributed to differential knowledge of exposure sources. In 2018, industrial slag and hazardous levels of soil contamination were detected in West Atlanta. We conducted community-engaged research through surveys and follow-up interviews to understand awareness of slag, HMM in soil, and potential remediation options. Home gardeners were more likely to recognize HMM health effects and to cite health as a significant benefit of gardening than community gardeners. In terms of knowledge, participants were concerned about the potential health effects of contaminants in soil yet unconcerned with produce in their gardens. Gardeners\u2019 knowledge on sources of HMM exposure and methods for remediation were low and varied based on racial group.

The current ways of managing waste, such as refuse collection and recycling, are failing to minimise waste in cities. With urban populations growing worldwide, there is the challenge of increased pressure to import food from rural areas. Urban agriculture not only presents an opportunity to explore other means of sustainable food production, but for managing organic waste in cities. However, this opportunity is not taken advantage of. Besides, there is a challenge of mixed reactions from urban planners and policymakers concerning the challenges and benefits presented by using organic waste in urban agriculture. The current paper explores the perceived challenges and opportunities for organic waste utilisation and management through urban agriculture in the Durban South Basin in eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. It is anticipated that this information will be of use to the eThekwini Municipality, policymakers, researchers, urban agriculture initiatives, households and relevant stakeholders in the study areas and similar contexts globally. Two hundred (200) households involved in any urban farming activity and ten (10) key informants (six (6) staff from the Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit of the eThekwini Municipality and four (4) from the urban agricultural initiative) were selected using convenient sampling. Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyse data. The significant perceived challenges and risks associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture included lack of a supporting policy, climatic variation, lack of land tenure rights, soil contamination and food safety concerns. Qualitative data further showed that the difficulty in segregating waste, water scarcity, difficulty in accessing inputs, limited transportation of organic waste, inadequate handling and treatment of organic waste, and being a health hazard were some important challenges. On the other hand, the significant perceived benefits associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture were enhanced food and nutrition security, and opportunities for business incubation. Other important benefits established through qualitative data were an improved market expansion for farmers and improved productivity. Overall, despite the perceived challenges and risks, there is an opportunity to manage organic waste through urban agriculture. It is imperative for an integrated policy encompassing the food, climate and waste management to be developed to support this strategy. All stakeholders\u2014the government, municipal authorities and urban agricultural initiatives should also, guided by the policy, support urban farmers, for example, through pieces of training on how to properly manage and recycle organic waste, land distribution, inputs availability and water usage rights among other things.

A joint field experiment was carried out to assess the role of seaweed-based extracts in pear trees and to test the \u201cless for more\u201d theory, which consists of getting more and better agricultural produce using fewer innovative inputs. The trials took place on two production seasons (from March till September 2018\u20132019) and the selected case study was on a pear orchard (Pyrus communis L. cv. Abate F\u00e8tel) in Emilia Romagna (Italy) by Fondazione Navarra and Timac Agro Italia S.p.A. Results demonstrate that, depending on the yearly climate conditions, it was possible to substantially reduce the primary nutrients by 35\u201346% and total fertilisation units applied by 13% and significantly improve quantitative and qualitative production indicators (average weight of fruits (5%) and total yield (19\u201355%)). Results also confirm a positive correlation between plant growth regulators and agronomic efficiency of pears which increased between five and nine times compared to the conventional nutrition programme. These outcomes constitute scientific evidence for decision making in farm management.

Dermal uptake is a known exposure route for dichlorvos and chemical protective gloves are commonly utilized. Chemical handling and application may occur in a variety of thermal environments, and the rates of both chemical permeation through gloves and transdermal penetration may vary significantly with temperature. There has been no published research on the temperature-dependent kinetics of these processes for dichlorvos and thus, this study reports on the effects of hot conditions for the concentrated and application strength chemical. Dichlorvos breakthrough times for non-disposable polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves at 60 \u00b0C were approximately halved compared to 25 \u00b0C for the concentrate (2 vs. 4 h) and more than halved at application strength (3 vs. >8 h). From permeation experiments covering 15\u201360 \u00b0C, there was a 460-fold increase in cumulative permeation over 8 h for the concentrated dichlorvos and the estimated activation energy halved. Elevated temperature was also shown to be a significant factor for human skin penetration increasing the cumulative penetration of concentrate dichlorvos from 179 \u00b1 37 to 1315 \u00b1 362 \u00b5g/cm2 (p = 0.0032) and application strength from 29.8 \u00b1 5.7 to 115 \u00b1 19 \u00b5g/cm2 (p = 0.0131). This work illustrates the important role temperature plays in glove performance and health risk via dermal exposure. As such, it is important to consider in-use conditions of temperature when implementing chemical hygiene programs.

However, the identity, functions, and the factors that influence the association of bacterial endophytes with desert plants are poorly known. These bacterial endophytes can be used as an untapped resource to favor plant growth and development in agro-ecosystems of arid regions. The present study is therefore focused on the isolation and identification of bacterial endophytes from two native medicinal plants (Fagonia mollis Delile and Achillea fragrantissima (Forssk) Sch. Bip.) growing spontaneously in the arid region of the South Sinai (Egypt), and characterization of their plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. Thirteen putative bacterial endophytes were isolated from the leaves of both plant species and characterized for their plant growth promoting abilities using molecular and biochemical approaches, as well as greenhouse trials. Selected endophytic bacterial strains were applied to maize plants (Zea mays L. var. Single cross Pioneer 30K08) to further evaluate their PGP abilities under greenhouse conditions. Isolated bacterial strains have variable plant growth promoting activities. Among these activities, isolated bacterial endophytes have the efficacy of phosphate solubilizing with clear zones ranging from 7.6 \u00b1 0.3 to 9.6 \u00b1 0.3 mm. Additionally, the obtained bacterial endophytes increased the productivity of indole acetic acid (IAA) in broth media from 10 to 60 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 with increasing tryptophan concentration from 1 to 5 mg\u00b7mL\u22121. Bacillus and Brevibacillus strains were frequently isolated from the leaves of both plant species, and had significant positive effects on plant growth and shoot phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) contents. Results suggest that these endophytes are good candidates as plant growth promoting inoculants to help reduce chemical input in conventional agricultural practices and increase nutrient uptake and stress resilience in plant species.", "Species from the crested wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.) complex have been widely used for revegetation and grazing on North American rangelands for over 100 years. Focused crested wheatgrass breeding has been ongoing since the 1920s. These efforts resulted in the development of 18 cultivars adapted to western USA and Canadian growing conditions. These cultivars establish rapidly, persist, and provide soil stabilization and a reliable feed source for domestic livestock and wildlife. To address ecological concerns and increase rangeland agriculture efficiency, crested wheatgrass breeding requires new emphases and techniques. This review covers the history of crested wheatgrass breeding and genetics in North America and discusses emerging methods and practices for improvement in the future.

Later, due to the shift towards an integrated control that has been quite successful in the control of aleyrodids, not so much in the control of aphids, aphid-borne viruses are having a significant revival in open field cultivation. Another threat is the continuous emergence of new species or variants of mechanically transmitted viruses. Thus, the number of viruses affecting these crops is constantly increasing and their control demands dynamic actions. The main measures that have managed to limit the damage of these diseases have been the improvement in the physical barriers that limit the spread of vectors and the introduction of resistances in the germplasm. Recently, the increased movement of plant materials and of people, the popularity of growing local crop varieties that lack natural resistances against pathogens, and the prospects of global climate change, may well have boosted the frequency of diseases and pests. Faced with this picture, strategies must be addressed from a multidisciplinary approach. The need for in-field diagnostics tools, easy access to information, novel breeding technologies and alternatives to control of these viruses are discussed.

However, machinery user\u2019s manuals and road signs report information regarding slope steepness in two different ways, by using the tilt angle in degrees and the slope percentage, respectively. In this study, we investigated the comprehension of safety signs depicting critical slopes, either in degrees or as percent values in a group of Italian agricultural machinery operators while considering the possible influence of previous experience with agricultural machinery, previous incidents, and on-farm occupation. Eighteen tractor and self-propelled machinery operators were administered graphical representations of seven slope angles in a randomized order and then were asked to estimate the slope steepness as both a tilt angle and a slope percentage. The participants tended to overestimate slope steepness in degrees, whereas the opposite was true for percentages. Farmers who were previously involved in a machinery-related incident were more accurate in their estimates. The present results raise some considerations regarding the need to redesign safety communication and to promote targeted training interventions.

Autonomous mowers can provide several advantages since these machines help to save time and energy and prevent operators from possible injuries. Current autonomous mowers operate by following random trajectories within areas defined by a shallow-buried boundary wire that has the purpose to generate an electro-magnetic field. Once the electro-magnetic field is perceived by the autonomous mower, the machine will stop and change direction. Mowing along random trajectories is considered an efficient solution to manage areas with a variable number of obstacles. In agriculture, autonomous technologies are becoming increasingly popular since they can help to increase both the quantity and quality of agricultural products by reducing productive cost and improving the production process. Thus, even autonomous mowers may be useful to carry out some of the agricultural operations that are highly time consuming. In fact, some autonomous mowers designed and realized to work in vineyards and home vegetable gardens are already available on the market. The aim of this study was to compare the work capacity of six autonomous mowers that move along random trajectories in areas with a high number of obstacles to assess if these machines may be employed in some agricultural contexts. The six autonomous mowers were split in three groups based on their size (large, medium, and small) and were left to work in two areas with equal number of obstacles but different layouts. The first area (Site A) had a square shape and an extension of 23.04 m2, in order to keep the autonomous mowers enclosed inside it. The second area (Site B) had a square shape and an extension of 84.64 m2, in order to have a part of the area with no obstacles. The layout and the size of the two areas affected the autonomous mowers performances in different ways. The six autonomous mowers working on Site A obtained similar results and higher performances compared to the same mowers working on Site B. All the autonomous mowers proved to be able to mow more than 89% of Site A after 2 h and more than 98% of Site A after 5 h. On Site B small size autonomous mowers obtained the best results mowing more than 83% of the area with obstacles after 2 h and more than 98% of the area with obstacles after 5 h. However, specific work settings allowed larger autonomous mowers to improve their efficiency, obtaining similar results compared to smaller autonomous mowers.

The improved temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the European Space Agency (ESA) launched Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform is paving the way to their popularization in precision agriculture. Besides the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation technical features the open-access nature of the information they generate, and the available support software are a significant improvement for agricultural monitoring. This paper was motivated by the challenges faced by researchers and agrarian institutions entering this field; it aims to frame remote sensing principles and Sentinel-2 applications in agriculture. Thus, we reviewed the features and uses of Sentinel-2 in precision agriculture, including abiotic and biotic stress detection, and agricultural management. We also compared the panoply of satellites currently in use for land remote sensing that are relevant for agriculture to the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation features. Contrasted with previous satellite image systems, the Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform has dramatically increased the capabilities for agricultural monitoring and crop management worldwide. Regarding crop stress monitoring, Sentinel-2 capacities for abiotic and biotic stresses detection represent a great step forward in many ways though not without its limitations; therefore, combinations of field data and different remote sensing techniques may still be needed. We conclude that Sentinel-2 has a wide range of useful applications in agriculture, yet still with room for further improvements. Current and future ways that Sentinel-2 can be utilized are also discussed. View Full-Text", "Flood recession farming is as an important supplement to rainfed agriculture in West Africa. Every year, large areas are flooded along riverbanks and temporary lakes. When water recedes from the flooded areas, farmers plant crops. This study describes the flood recession farming in the Yelimane district of Kayes region in Mali and assesses different ways to intensify the system. The use of external inputs in this system is minimal. Field experiments were undertaken over two years to test crop establishment methods, soil tillage, increasing plant density, use of organic and mineral fertilizer, and improved varieties. These technologies increased sorghum yield as compared to the control in the following descending order: Seed priming + fertilizer (77.1%), NPK + organic fertilizer (74%), seedling transplantation + micro fertilization (61.3%), improved varieties (49%), mounding (34%), and urea application (24.9%). The technology seed priming in combination with mineral fertilizers was promising because of the high yield and the low labor demand. Nitrogen fertilizer is needed in flood recession agriculture as the soils and the deposited sediments are low in nitrogen. Farmers\u2019 choice of technology will depend on the yield level, net return per hectare, labor use, and access to inputs.

This study analyzed the connection between strategies implemented by extension services and technology adoption on family farms. Using the case of the Servicio de Asesor\u00eda T\u00e9cnica (SAT) Program, we developed a bottom-up adoption index (AI) for vegetable and berry farmers in three regions of Central Chile. We implemented 10 focus groups totaling 101 participants, all recipients of technical assistance from private extension companies (PECs) funded by the SAT Program. After the focus group sessions, we surveyed participating farmers to gather information on socio-economic attributes and adopted technologies. Using cluster analysis, we identified three groups of farmers according to their adoption intensity. The results indicate that extension strategies used by PECs have distinct effects on the adoption of new technologies. Higher adoption indexes were positively associated with the duration of the extension visits, the number of group activities, and the use of incentives and credits provided by the Chilean government. The value of production and farm size were positively associated with adoption intensity. View Full-Text", "Soil degradation is the greatest threat to agricultural production globally. The practice of applying or retaining crop residues in the field as mulch is imperative to prevent soil erosion, maintain soil quality and improve crop productivity. However, smallholder farmers resort to maximizing profit by removing crop residues after harvest to sell or use them as feed for livestock. Agrimats are innovative pro-smallholder farming mulching materials that are manufactured using cheap or freely available organic waste materials. These materials include forestry waste, grasses, etc., therefore allowing smallholder farmers to make more profit through improved crop productivity for better food security. The most notable attributes of agrimats include their ability to prevent soil erosion, increase and sustain soil organic matter, suppress weeds, and conserve soil moisture. Food security challenge can be addressed by adopting agrimat technology as a sustainable permanent soil cover to improve soil quality and crop productivity. Agrimat incorporation in conservation agriculture practice could produce more food from less input resources (chemical fertilizers, water, etc.) with minimal or no adverse effect on the environment. This study aims to advocate permanent soil cover using agrimat as an innovative pro-smallholder farmer technology to improve soil quality for better food security.

Thus, there is need for agricultural producers in Africa to employ robust adaptive measures that withstand the risks of climate change. However, the success of adaptation measures to climate change primarily depends on the communities\u2019 knowledge or awareness of climate change and its risks. Nonetheless, existing empirical research is still limited to illuminate farmers\u2019 awareness of the climate change problem. This study employs a Bayesian hierarchical logistic model, estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, to empirically determine drivers of smallholder farmers\u2019 awareness of climate change and its risks to agriculture in Zambia. The results suggest that on average, 77% of farmers in Zambia are aware of climate change and its risks to agriculture. We find socio-demographics, climate change information sources, climate change adaptive factors, and climate change impact-related shocks as predictors of the expression of climate change awareness. We suggest that farmers should be given all the necessary information about climate change and its risks to agriculture. Most importantly, the drivers identified can assist policymakers to provide the effective extension and advisory services that would enhance the understanding of climate change among farmers in synergy with appropriate farm-level climate-smart agricultural practices.

However, little is known about whether rural infrastructure enables the promotion of resource-conserving agriculture and reduces production costs. Understanding the relationship between rural infrastructure and production costs can provide significant information for policy-makers in their efforts to promote resource-saving agriculture that is beneficial to environmental performance. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the heterogeneous effects of irrigation infrastructure and standard and substandard roads on agricultural production costs, using an unconditional quantile regression model and provincial data from China for the period 1995\u20132017. The empirical results show that the effects of rural infrastructure on production costs are mixed. In particular, irrigation infrastructure affects production costs positively in the lower quantiles, but it negatively affects production costs in the higher quantiles. In the higher 80th and 90th quantiles, standard and substandard roads affect production costs both negatively and significantly. Our findings suggest that improving rural infrastructure enables the promotion of resource-conserving agriculture and enhances environmental performance, especially for those paying high production costs.

The extraction rate of natural resources has increased by 113% since 1990, which has led to overexploitation and generation of vast amounts of waste. For this reason, it is essential that a sustainable development model is adopted\u2014one which makes it possible to produce more food and energy with fewer fossil fuels, low pollutant gas emissions and minimal solid waste. Certain management policies and approaches, such as the strategy of a circular ecocomy or bioeconomy, are oriented towards sustainable production and consumption. The present study focuses on the importance of intensive horticulture in the Mediterranean region, specifically in the province of Almer\u00eda (Spain). After having conducted a study of the main crops in this area, it was determined that the waste biomass generated presented strong potential for exploitation. With the proper regulatory framework, which promotes and prioritises the circularity of agricultural waste, there are several opportunities for improving the current waste management model. In the same way, the results of the economic evaluation demonstrate that the alternative of self-management of waste biomass is profitable, specifically from tomato crops. Compost and green fertilizer production also prove to be a key strategy in the transition towards a more circular and sustainable agricultural production model. As for the said transition, government support is vital in terms of carrying out awareness campaigns and training activities and providing financing for Research and Development (R&D).

Although this field offers great potential, data on the impact on crop growth and development are insufficient. As such, this study examines the impact of agriculture\u2013photovoltaic farming on crops using energy information and communications technology (ICT). The researched crops were grapes, cultivated land was divided into six sections, photovoltaic panels were installed in three test areas, and not installed in the other three. A 1300 \u00d7 520 mm photovoltaic module was installed on a screen that was designed with a shading rate of 30%. In addition, to collect farming-cultivation-environment data and to analyze power generation, sensors for growing environments and wireless-communication devices were used. As a result, normal modules generated 25.2 MWh, bifacial modules generated 21.6 MWh, and transparent modules generated 25.7 MWh over a five-month period. We could not find a difference in grape growth according to the difference of each module. However, a slight slowing of grape growth was found in the experiment group compared to the control group. Nevertheless, the sugar content of the test area of the grape fruit in the harvest season was 17.6 Brix on average, and the sugar content of the control area was measured at 17.2 Brix. Grape sugar-content level was shown to be at almost the same level as that in the control group by delaying the harvest time by about 10 days. In conclusion, this study shows that it is possible to produce renewable energy without any meaningful negative impact on normal grape farming.

This can cause more problems where the soil surface is thin and rocky like Jeju Island in the Republic of Korea. This is because overly used nitrogen fertilizer can be washed into the underground water and pollute it. Thus, it would be important to monitor the nitrogen deficiency of crops in the field to provide the right amount of nitrogen in a timely manner so that nitrogen waste can be limited. To achieve this, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to monitor chlorophyll content, which is tightly associated with nitrogen content in the buckwheat field. The NDVI was calculated with the data obtained by a low-resolution camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. The results showed that the NDVI can estimate the chlorophyll content of buckwheat. These simple but clear results imply that precision agriculture could be achieved even with a low-resolution camera in a cost-effective manner to reduce the pollution of underground water.

These systems constitute a feasible alternative for ensuring food supply, which is one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the twenty-first century. Technology has been able to meet the challenges related to greenhouse farming in both contributing to overcoming its limitations, correcting adverse impacts and ensuring system sustainability. The objective of this article is to analyse the global research trends in greenhouse technology over the last two decades, in order to identify the main driving agents, the most outstanding research lines and possible gaps in the literature. Different methodologies have been used for the analysis; both quantitative and qualitative. The principal results show that there are different relevant lines of research related to different aspects of greenhouse farming: the use of water for irrigation, the design of the optimum structure of the greenhouse, conserving the soil in the best growing conditions, energy consumption of the system as a whole, climate control within the facility and pest control. The research is characterized by the being composed largely of ad hoc studies, which hinders the international collaboration between researchers and institutions.

Due to the requirements of more processing power for computations and predictions, the concept of Cloud-based smart agriculture is proposed for autonomic systems. This is where digital innovation and technology helps to improve the quality of life in the area of urbanization expansion. For the integration of cloud in smart agriculture, the system is shown to have security and privacy challenges, and most significantly, the identification of malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of information between sensors, cloud, and base station (BS). The identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud communications. The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes. In this article, we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters. The trust mechanism is an event-driven process that computes trust based on the pre-defined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree to develop an absolute trust degree. The system also maintains the trust degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches. We have also performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism against several potential attacks. In addition, this research helps to create friendlier environments and efficient agricultural productions for the migration of people to the cities.

The results show that 91.92% of the farmers adopted CA technology. Part-time farming had a highly significant positive influence on the likelihood of adoption. Moreover, the impact degree increased along with the deepening of part-time farming. In addition, farmers\u2019 adoption behaviors were affected by gender, contracted land area, economic welfare cognition and social welfare cognition. Our results help to understand farmers\u2019 complex decision-making on farmland and to promote the sustainable development of agriculture in Jianghan Plain.

The Philippines is one of the world\u2019s primary banana and pineapple producers. The input-intensive style of plantation agriculture for these typically exported crops has many adverse effects on the environment. While global studies have attempted to understand the biodiversity impacts of agricultural goods, there are few studies that have investigated the Philippines specifically. In this study, Philippine policies and data are investigated to better characterize the nexus between agriculture, biodiversity, and trade. An analysis of key national policies highlights that more stringent definitions and protections for biodiversity are needed to recognize the increasing roles that agricultural production, and importantly, its global trade, have on threatened Philippine species. A geographical analysis shows that many banana and pineapple plantations in Mindanao and their surrounding agricultural impact zones overlap with ecologically important areas, such as Protected Areas and Important Bird Areas. Overlaps of recorded species occurrence are observed within the immediate zones surrounding 250 plantations for banana and pineapple in Mindanao, with 83 threatened species of Philippine fauna and tree at risk of exposure to the impacts of intensive agriculture.

This results in stagnated crop productivity and declined farm profitability with increased emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, 3-year multi-location farmer\u2019s participatory research trial was conducted to assess the impact of crop establishment and residue management techniques on crop productivity, economic profitability and environmental footprints in RWS. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of combinations of improved agronomic technologies compared to farmer\u2019s practices (FP) on crop productivity, profitability, resource use efficiency and environmental footprints. The experiment had six scenarios that is, S1-Farmer\u2019s practice; Conventional tillage (CT) without residue; S2-CT with residue, S3- Reduced tillage (RT) with residue + Recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF); S4-RT/zero tillage (ZT) with residue + RDF, S5-ZT with residue + RDF + green seeker + tensiometer + information & communication technology + crop insurance and S6- S5 + site specific nutrient management. Climate smart agriculture practices (CSAPs; mean of S4, S5 and S6) increase system productivity and farm profitability by 10.5% and 29.4% (on 3 yrs\u2019 mean basis), whereas, improved farmers practices (mean of S2 and S3) resulted in only 3.2% and 5.3% increments compared to farmer\u2019s practice (S1), respectively. On an average, CSAPs saved 39.3% of irrigation water and enhanced the irrigation and total water productivity by 53.9% and 18.4% than FP, respectively. In all the 3-years, CSAPs with high adaptive measures enhanced the energy-use-efficiency (EUE) and energy productivity (EP) by 43%\u201354% and 44%\u201361%, respectively than FP. In our study, global warming potential (GWP), GHG emission due to consumption energy and greenhouse gas intensity were recorded lower by 43%, 56% and 59% in Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) with high adaptive measures than farmers practices (3652.7 kg CO2 eq. ha\u22121 yr\u22121, 722.2 kg CO2 eq. ha\u22121 yr\u22121 and 718.7 Mg kg\u22121 CO2 eq. ha\u22121 yr\u22121). The findings of the present study revealed that CSA with adaption of innovative measures (S6) improved 3-year mean system productivity by 10.5%, profitability by 29.4%, water productivity and energy productivity by 18.3% and 48.9%, respectively than FP. Thus, the results of our 3-year farmer\u2019s participatory study suggest that in a RW system, climate smart agriculture practices have better adaptive capacity and could be a feasible option for attaining higher yields, farm profitability, energy-use efficiency and water productivity with sustained/improved environmental quality in smallholder production systems of Eastern IGP of India and other similar agro-ecologies of South Asia. Finally, the adoption of these CSAPs should be promoted in the RW rotation of IGP to ensure food security, restoration of soil health and to mitigate climate change, the key sustainable development goals (SDGs).

One of the ideas to overcome this problem is the eco-efficiency concept, analyzing the agricultural output in relation, not only to traditional inputs, but to the environmental impact, as well. This paper aims at calculating the eco-efficiency of Polish commercial farms, based on a representative sample of 601 farms participating in the Polish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). To assess the eco-efficiency of the farms, variables illustrating traditional inputs (land, labor, capital), as well as variables reflecting the environmental pressure of the surveyed farms (greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen and phosphorus surpluses) were used. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) revealed that, on average, farms could reduce their inputs by almost a quarter without reducing their outputs. Additionally, it was revealed that incorporating externalities of agricultural production into analyses decreases the diversity of the farm population in terms of efficiency measures. According to the analyses, more eco-efficient farms are characterized by larger utilized agricultural area (UAA), higher production value, and higher intensity of chemical inputs per 1 ha, but at the same time by lower amounts of inputs used per production unit. Moreover, more eco-efficient farms achieved higher farm incomes in many terms: total, per 1 ha of UAA, and per 1 EUR of production value.

The surveys were carried out based on a synthetic technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS)-based measure. This method synthesizes factors of various nature and assigns them a synthetic aggregate measure. The analysis made it possible to develop a ranking of EU member states according to a differentiated level of measures and assign them to one of four groups characterized by different levels of sustainability in agriculture. The group of member states representing the highest level of sustainability in agriculture included two countries from Central and Eastern Europe, i.e., Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The group of countries with a greater than average level of sustainability comprised 14 member states of the European Union, including seven countries admitted to the community after 2004. The group with a low level of sustainability consisted of eight EU member states, six of them from the group of old EU member states, i.e., Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and two new members, i.e., Romania and Slovenia. On the other hand, the lowest level of sustainability was characteristic of two \u201cold EU\u201d member states, i.e., The Netherlands and Belgium, and two \u201cnew EU\u201d member states, i.e., Cyprus and Malta. The differentiated synthetic measure values showed disparities in the level of sustainability in agriculture among the member states of the European Union.

The results point out eleven main factors related to the offerings on the organic agriculture market that predominantly drive green consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. The Relative Importance Index identified health benefits that stem from a specific way of production as the main purchasing motive. This was also confirmed by the results of logistic regression, which showed that a respondent who buys organic agricultural products on a daily basis is approximately 71.5% less likely to disagree with the claim that organic products are healthier than non-organic, compared to a consumer who purchases organic products several times a week or month. However, as these benefits cannot be empirically confirmed, green consumers look for official labels on the product packaging. In order to assure the product quality, more than half of them find out very important information about producers: whether they have a product quality certificate (69.5%), how many years they are engaged in production (56.2%), and whether they have specific product packaging (54.9%). The Relative Importance Index also revealed that the main purchasing barriers that consumers face are scarce offerings and an insufficient development of the distribution channel, which were ranked in first and second place. The price as a barrier is of less importance. About 30.8% of the respondents are willing to pay up to 20% higher prices for organic food compared to conventional food, while 39.4% of them would pay even up to 40% higher prices. Based on the given results, there are clear suggestions for creating a sustainable marketing strategy for organic agriculture products as the main prerequisite for an increase of healthy food choices and fostering the future development of organic agriculture businesses at the local and global levels.

Many of these studies testify on the growing importance of ICT in influencing the evolution of the sector, especially by bringing down information barriers. While the potentialities of such technologies are widely investigated and confirmed, there is still a gap in understanding and modeling decisions on ICT information implementation. This gap concerns, in particular, accounting for all the aspects of uncertainty which are mainly due to a lack of knowledge on the reliability of ICT and on the errors of ICT-information. Overall, such uncertainties might affect Decision Makers\u2019 (DM\u2019s) behavior and hamper ICT uptake. To support policy makers in the designing of uncertainty-management policies for the achievement of the benefits of a digital irrigated agriculture, we further investigated the topic of uncertainty modelling in ICT uptake decisions. To do so, we reviewed the economic literature on ambiguity, in the context of the wider literature on decision making under uncertainty in order to explore its potential for better modeling ICT uptake decisions. Findings from the discussed literature confirm the capabilities of this approach to yield a deeper understanding of decision processes when the reliability of ICT is unknown and provides better insights on how behavioral barriers to the achievement of potential ICT-benefits can be overcome. Policy implications to accompany the sector in the digitalization process include mainly: (a) defining new approaches for ICT-developers to tailor platforms to answer heterogeneous DMs\u2019 needs; (b) establish uncertainty-management policies complementary to DM tools adoption.

Games are also popular for non-experimental purposes such as recreating learning experiences and facilitating dialogue with local communities. After a systematic review of the literature, we found that the volume of published studies employing coordination and cooperation games increased during the 2000\u20132020 period. In recent years, more attention has been given to the areas of natural resource management, conservation, and ecology, particularly in regions important to agricultural sustainability. Other games, such as trust and risk games, have come to be regarded as standards of artefactual and framed field experiments in agriculture. Regardless of their scope, most games\u2019 results are subject to criticism for their internal and external validity. In particular, a significant portion of the games reviewed here reveal recruitment biases towards women and provide few opportunities for continued impact assessment. However, games\u2019 validity should be judged on a case-by-case basis. Specific cultural aspects of games might reflect the real context, and generalizing games\u2019 conclusions to different settings is often constrained by cost and utility. Overall, games in agriculture could benefit from more significant, frequent, and inclusive experiments and data\u2014all possibilities offered by digital technology. Present-day physical distance restrictions may accelerate this shift. New technologies and engaging mediums to approach farmers might present a turning point for integrating experimental and non-experimental games for agriculture in the 21st century.

However, the effects of such practices in soil under citrus orchards have not been well characterized. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of mowing and intercrop species on soil microbiological characteristics beneath a Tahiti acid lime orchard. The orchard was planted using minimum tillage and intercropped with two species of Urochloa species (U. ruziziensis\u2014ruzi grass; U. decumbens\u2014signal grass), with two types of mowers for Urochloa biomass (ecological; conventional) and herbicide applications. The study was conducted over 10 years. The ecological mower made the largest deposition of the intercrop biomass, thus providing the lowest disturbance of soil microbial activity and increasing, on average over all 10 years, the basal soil respiration (45%), microbial biomass carbon (25%), abundance of 16S rRNA (1.5%) and ITS (3.5%) genes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (30%), and providing a ca. 20% higher fruit yield. U. ruziziensis in combination with ecological mowing stimulated the abundance of the genes nifH (1.5%) and phoD (3.0%). The herbicide showed little influence. We conclude that the use of U. ruziziensis as an intercrop in citrus orchards subjected to ecological mowing can be recommended for improving and sustaining soil quality and citrus fruit production.

The pressure of urbanization has led to a mismatch between production and consumption in space and pattern. The current status and trends in urban food system planning illustrated that sustainable consumption and production were closely related to their spatial layout. The paper took a simulated sustainable food system in urban community as an example. It formulated a rational spatial planning strategy based on urban agriculture of different scales, technologies, and efficiencies, quantified productive community metrics to accommodate different scales of urban space, and wrote algorithms to develop a spatial model of a meta-cellular automaton that coupled consumer housing with productive surfaces. Finally, by comparing and optimizing the spatial patterns of multiple solutions, urban agriculture-oriented urban community planning was developed. The model was only a preliminary attempt at food system planning, but it explored the distribution patterns of housing and agriculture within a given territory in three steps: theoretical strategy-morphological simulation-planning design while meeting urban and productivity indicators. It demonstrated the feasibility of productive spaces and explored a planning strategy for urban communities that supports sustainable consumption and production.

Global warming and climate change, weather disasters and disruptions are just some of the challenges that can drastically disrupt stable business models, and thus jeopardize sustainability. Agriculture, as an activity at the center of the value chain, is facing these problems, and, at the same time, contributes to feeding the growing world population and is responsible for conserving resources and ensuring sustainability. Process automation, data analysis and processing, control and management of agricultural operations have transformed the agricultural business and contributed to sustainability, survival and development within supply chains. This article analyzes the literature in the field of sustainability and agriculture led by digital technologies of Industry 4.0. The analysis of the research field showed the high importance of the topic in academic and national circles, given the number of published articles. Secondly, the concepts of sustainable agriculture and sustainability driven agriculture in the context of digital transformation were analyzed and it was shown that transformed agriculture can successfully cope with today\u2019s challenges. Finally, guidelines for sustainable development driven by agriculture through the determinants of digital transformation are defined.

Shifting to a diet lower in meat consumption has been emphasized in several studies. Based on the Planetary Health Diet developed by the EAT-Lancet Commission, this study investigates the effect on agricultural greenhouse gas emissions of transitioning the Danish agricultural system, which currently relies mainly on meat and dairy production, towards increased focus on plant-based foods, combined with replacement or reduction of imported feed and carbon sequestration on previous agricultural land. The study finds a large potential for reducing emissions from Danish agriculture through implementation of the Planetary Health Diet, with reductions of up to 21.7 Mt CO2e (CO2 equivalents) (92.9%) under the most ambitious conditions. This demonstrates the potentially large benefits from transitioning towards a more plant-based European agricultural sector and underscores the need for European and national policies incentivizing this transition.

However, global problems with the environment, increasing pollution, and gas heating emissions have made environmental issues a major priority. Suddenly, human beings have realized that environmental investments are needed to maintain better world conditions for future generations. This article investigates the development of agricultural investment in the context of production factors in Polish voivodeships in the years 2000\u20132018. Farmers have to choose between investing and developing production or being more environmentally friendly and invest on a smaller scale or transform their farms into organic production. Moreover, the investment in environmental protection in Poland was analyzed. Investment outlays on fixed assets for environmental protection and outlays on fixed assets for water management were investigated. The level of investment has changed since Poland joined the EU. With membership, Poland gained access to new markets and technology. Particular attention has been focused on production factors (land, capital, and the work force). We have conducted as a proxy regular regression analysis and after panel regression to measure the impact of the chosen factors on explained variables: investment outlays in agriculture, and investment outlays per 1 ha of agricultural land. We have used correlation analysis to examine the relations between explanatory variables and total gross investment in agriculture and total investment outlays in agriculture per 1 ha of agricultural land, outlays on fixed assets for environmental protection, and outlays on fixed assets for water management. Our analysis confirms that explanatory variables are important in shaping total investment outlays in agriculture and total investment outlays per 1 ha of agricultural land.

Initiatives to promote pro-health dietary behaviour are possibly being compromised by poor or inconsistent consumer accessibility to affordable and safe fresh fruits and vegetables, referred to as the agriculture\u2013nutrition\u2013income nexus. While donors increasingly focus on nutrition-sensitive agriculture across the Pacific, there is little contemporary information concerning Tonga\u2019s domestic horticultural distribution and market system, particularly in regards to food loss. This study surveyed 292 municipal and road-side vendors on Tongatapu and \u2018Utu Vava\u2019u Islands, with the aim of mapping and analyzing horticultural markets and farm supply, transport logistics, and quantifying postharvest practice and market loss. Tonga\u2019s domestic horticultural market structure consists of a central municipal market and on Tongatapu Island, a supplementary network of urban and rural based road-side vendors. There is limited inter-island trade, with most farms located within 25 km of the central municipal market. Mean postharvest horticultural loss was very low, at 1.4% to 5.3%, with road-side vendors more vulnerable to loss. This level of loss was thought to reflect short intra-island transport distance, the type of crops being traded, and rapid market throughput, rather than a level of value chain efficiency. Vendors regulated market supply volume and price discounting and were the principal strategies to mitigate postharvest loss. While low levels of postharvest loss, short transport logistics, and fast market throughput are consistent with a relatively efficient horticulture market system, vendor practice may be impeding fresh fruit and vegetable accessibility.

In order to implement these systems, it is necessary to replace the traditional model of \u201cextract-use-consume-dispose\u201d with a model based on the principles of the Circular Economy (CE), optimizing the use of resources and minimizing the generation of waste. Almer\u00eda has become a paradigm of this type of high-yield agricultural system, with the largest concentration of greenhouses in the world. This study analyses the opportunities that the CE can offer the intensive agriculture sector in Almer\u00eda in order to obtain long-term sustainability. The results show a wide variety of alternatives, both on an agricultural exploitation level and in the case of the product packaging and wholesale centers. The priority areas of action are waste management, the prevention of product waste and the improvement in the efficiency of the use of water and energy. The principal limitations for adopting circular practices are the large investment required, the limited transfer of knowledge between the different users and the lack of sufficient support from the government and the sector.

Making agriculture sustainable has become so essential that it has become part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However, producers ultimately decide individually the practices they implement. This is why farmers play a central role in ensuring a sustainable agricultural system, which results from farmers\u2019 knowledge and expectations. Although numerous studies address sustainability issues, little is known about farmers\u2019 knowledge and implementation of sustainable practices at different types of farms, especially in central and eastern Europe. This study aimed to determine Polish farmers\u2019 awareness of sustainability with regards to animal and crop production. This paper also shows how farmers value the advantages arising from sustainable production. The study was carried out among 300 farms classified by type (dairy, beef cattle, pork, and crop production). The research instrument used was a questionnaire, with the Likert scale. The results show that dairy farmers and pork farmers declared higher knowledge and better implement sustainable practices than other farmers. The producers\u2019 views on the benefits coming from sustainable agriculture varied.

These systems may have the potential to provide rural electrification and encourage rural development, as PV panels are now becoming more financially attractive due to their falling costs. The implementation of solar PV systems in such areas improves social and communal services, water supply and agriculture, as well as other productive activities. It may also convert these communities into more environmentally sustainable ones. The present paper details two case studies from Palestine and shows the inter-relation between energy, water and food in rural areas to demonstrate how the availability of sustainable energy can ensure water availability, improve agricultural productivity and increase food security. Further, the paper attempts to evaluate the technical and economic impacts of the application of nexus approaches to Palestine\u2019s rural areas.

Climate change in Romania is part of the global context, taking into account the regional conditions, with an increasing trend of arid summer. While the link between high temperatures, climate change and rainfall has been modeled in detail, the situation is not the same for plant water accessibility. The period of time between 1898 and the present, corresponding to the annual records of precipitation and evapotranspiration, overlapped with important political and administrative changes in the studied area, and with extensive hydro-amelioration works. The aim of the paper is to statistically follow the evolution over time of precipitation, namely of evapotranspiration measured in Western Romania, which would allow the expression of conclusions regarding the improvement directions of the water regime. In order to follow the evolution in time of these data, the interval of 1898\u20132019 was divided into three periods: 1898\u20131950, 1951\u20131989 and 1990\u20132019, respectively.

However, agriculture green technology diffusion is indeed a challenging task and still faces numerous barriers. The stakeholders who can potentially deal with these barriers, however, have been overlooked by previous studies. To address these issues, social network analysis was performed to identify critical stakeholders and barriers. Their interactions in agriculture green technology diffusion were analyzed based on the literature, a questionnaire survey and expert judgments. A two-mode network and two one-mode networks were used to analyze the relationships among the identified 12 barriers and 14 stakeholders who can influence these 12 barriers identified. The results show that agricultural research institutes, universities, agribusiness, agencies of township promotion, the government and farmers\u2019 relatives are key stakeholders and that the limited market demand for green technology and the high cost of its diffusion are two main barriers.

To utilize a minimum amount of inputs and complete the task without a revisit, one needs to employ optimized routes and optimal points of delivering the inputs required in precision agriculture (PA). First, stressed regions are identified using VegNet (Vegetative Network) software. Then, methods are applied for obtaining optimal routes and points for the spraying of inputs with an autonomous UAV for PA. This paper reports a unique and innovative technique to calculate the optimum location of spray points required for a particular stressed region. In this technique, the stressed regions are divided into many circular divisions with its center being a spray point of the stressed region. These circular divisions would ensure a more effective dispersion of the spray. Then an optimal path is found out which connects all the stressed regions and their spray points. The paper also describes the use of methods and algorithms including travelling salesman problem (TSP)-based route planning and a Voronoi diagram which allows applying precision agriculture techniques.

Managing natural resources and mainstreaming biodiversity across agriculture sectors are keys towards a sustainable agriculture focused on resource efficiency. Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) is considered the main driving force of water movements in the plant vascular system, however the tools available to monitor this parameter are usually based on environmental monitoring. The driving motif of this paper is the development of an in-vivo sensor to monitor the effects of VPD changes in the plant.

Price risks, which are generally not insurable per se, have been covered by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has been shaped as a system of protection against market shocks and an instrument for income stabilization. However, there is an increasing propensity to combine the use of public and private risk management tools as well. In Spain, revenue insurance has not yet developed in the same way as other risk coverage insurance, although it is an upcoming target of agricultural insurance policies with the aim of ensuring income stability for agricultural producers.

The results showed that soil bulk density (BD) was significantly higher in cropland plots compared to the vineyard and olive orchard. No differences were observed in soil water content (SWC) and mean weight diameter (MWD). Water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic matter (SOM), and total nitrogen (TN) were significantly higher in the olive orchard compared to the other land uses. In cropland, during the experiment, we did not identify runoff or soil losses. Runoff (Run) and sediment loss (SL) were significantly higher in the olive orchard compared to the other plots. This was very likely a consequence of tillage practices in vertic soils, the use of herbicides, low vegetation cover, as well as the incorporation of hydrophobic organic matter in the soil matrix. The principal component analysis results showed that factor 1 explained the majority of the runoff and erosion variables. Erosion rates and nutrient losses were substantially different between olive orchard plots, and vineyard and cropland. Factor 2 showed that WSA was inversely related to the available phosphorus, water holding capacity, and sediment concentration. Management practices in the studied area should use minimum tilling frequency to have plant cover and avoid erosion.

The spatial representation of these agricultural data through yield and fruit quality maps allows for crop management in a precise way that means that agricultural operations may be carried out considering intraorchard variability, thus resulting in greater efficiency. The aim of this work was to advance the development of new tools for the generation of yield and quality maps for precision agriculture. A new tool was implemented for citrus through a dashboard called CitrusYield that integrates the requirements demanded by technicians and farmers in terms of spatial distribution and the quality of their citrus production. The data for testing were collected by a prototype of a citrus harvest-assist platform. In order to obtain maps showing heterogeneity of production, an experimental plot with different varieties and variable production was chosen. The maps, tables and graphs showing different crop data were generated automatically by CitrusYield from the analysis of the data collected. The main advantage of knowing the differences in production between the swaths and areas inside the crop is to provide the grower with precise information to make accurate decisions for localised crop management, such as fertilisation, irrigation, pest and disease control, etc. View Full-Text", "Combining agriculture with behaviour change communication and other nutrition-sensitive interventions could improve feeding practices to reduce maternal and child undernutrition. Such integrated intervention requires rigorous design and an appropriate implementation strategy to generate an impact. We assessed feasibility and acceptability of an intervention package that combines nutrition counselling, counselling and support for home-gardening, and unconditional cash transfers delivered to women on a mobile platform for improving maternal and child nutrition behaviours among low-income families in rural Bangladesh. We used mixed-methods including in-depth interviews with women (20), key-informant interviews with project workers (6), and a cross sectional survey of women (60). Women well-accepted the intervention and reported to be benefited by acquiring new skills and information on home gardening and nutrition. They established homestead gardens of seasonal vegetables successfully and were able to find a solution for major challenges. All women received the cash transfer. Ninety-one percent of women spent the cash for buying foods, 20% spent it on purchasing seeds or fertilizers and 57% used it for medical and livelihood purchases. Project staff and mobile banking agent reported no difficulty in cash transfer. Combining nutrition-specific and -sensitive interventions is a feasible and acceptable approach.

An experiment initiated in 1997 to evaluate the level of tillage and the amount of soil cover needed for conservation agriculture to work under irrigated conditions in the highlands of San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico. The trial encompassed seven treatments: conventional tillage, two types of reduced tillage and permanent raised beds (PB), which are untilled, with four levels of soil cover in an irrigated rotation with maize (Zea mays L.) in the summer and fodder oats (Avena sativa L.) in the winter. Maize and oats yielded significantly more under PB than with tillage. Maize yielded on average 1.2 Mg ha\u22121 more in PB with the hybrid used from 1997 to 2008 and 3.9 Mg ha\u22121 more with the hybrid used from 2012 to 2017. Permanent raised beds generated on average $18,424 MXN ha\u22121 more profit than the tilled treatments and increased soil organic carbon on average 63% at 0 to 5 cm depth and 32% at 5 to 30 cm depth.

In this three-year field experiment, we tested the performances of an innovative vegetable organic and conservative system (ORG+) combining the use of cover crops (exploited as either living or dead mulch) and no-till techniques. This system was compared to \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d organic farming (ORG) and integrated farming system (INT) based on the same crop sequence: savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda L. cv. Famosa), spring lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Justine), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. Cv. Montebianco), and summer lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Ballerina RZ). The results of crop yield parameters and weed abundance contribute to spotlight potentialities and weaknesses of organic-conservative management of field vegetables. In particular, ORG+ caused significant yield depletion for all the crops and revealed suboptimal weed control and N availability. The agroecosystem services provided by the cover crops grown in the ORG+ as dead mulch or living mulch were affected by weather conditions and not always resulted in significant crop gain. Nevertheless, interesting results in terms of P availability and reduced N surplus encourage further development of the system targeting more sustainable organic vegetable production.

Consequently, soil-based decisions are often made using a data limiting approach, as the value proposition of soil data collection has not been well described. The work presented here investigates the spatial errors of gypsum and lime recommendations based on industry-standard blanket-rate and zone-based variable rate application, as well as the more advanced pedometric approaches \u2013 ordinary kriging (OK) and regression kriging (RK). All methods were tested at sampling densities between 0.1\u20133 samples/ha for a 108 ha broadacre site in central NSW, Australia. Whilst previous work has tested the effect of sampling density on the spatial predictive performance of OK and RK, here we assess prediction accuracy as the error associated with soil management decisions based on their results (i.e., the over- and under-application error of gypsum and lime applications) in conjunction with the RMSE of prediction for soil pH and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The uncertainty of each method is also tested to observe the effect of random initialisation on predictive performance. Results indicated that RK provided superior spatial predictions across all sampling densities for the application of gypsum and lime, with a blanket-rate application providing the worse results, with over- and under-application errors exceeding 200 t and 300 t respectively for 40\u201360 cm treatment for the entire field. Interestingly, the spatial accuracy of amendment application increased to a sampling density of 0.5 samples/ha for RK, with minimal improvement thereafter, suggesting that meaningful soil amelioration advice can be attained proximal to this density.

Usually, these sensor nodes (SNs) alternate their states between periods of activation and hibernation to reduce battery usage. When employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from SNs distributed over a large agricultural area, we must synchronize the UAV route with the activation period of each SN. In this article, we address the problem of optimizing the UAV path through all the SNs to reduce its flight time, while also maximizing the SNs\u2019 lifetime. Using the concept of timeslots for time base management combined with the idea of flight prohibition list, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering and reconfiguring the activation time of the SNs. Experimental results were obtained through the development of our own simulator\u2014UAV Simulator. These results demonstrate a considerable reduction in the distance traveled by the UAV and also in its flight time. In addition, the model provides a reduction in transmission time by SNs after reconfiguration, thus ensuring a longer lifetime for the SNs in the monitoring environment, as well as improving the freshness and continuity of the gathered data, which support the decision-making process.

The rapid development of engineered biochar produced using different feedstock materials via various methods for wastewater treatment in recent years urges an up-to-date review on this topic. This article centers on summarizing state-of-the-art methods for engineered biochar production and discussing the multidimensional benefits of applying biochar for water reuse and soil amendment in a closed-loop agriculture system. Based on numerous recent articles (<5 years) published in journals indexed in the Web of Science, engineered biochar\u2019s production methods, modification techniques, physicochemical properties, and performance in removing inorganic, organic, and emerging contaminants from wastewater are reviewed in this study. It is concluded that biochar-based technologies have great potential to be used for treating both point-source and diffuse-source wastewater in agricultural systems, thus decreasing water demand while improving crop yields. As biochar can be produced using crop residues and other biomass wastes, its on-farm production and subsequent applications in a closed-loop agriculture system will not only eliminate expensive transportation costs, but also create a circular flow of materials and energy that promotes additional environmental and economic benefits.

A healthy community includes four aspects of health, namely, healthy production, healthy lifestyle, healthy environment and ecosystem, and healthy physical and mental states of residents living in the community. Urban agriculture (UA), as a form of the community garden, is a supplementary form for the lack of production function in the urban community. It also has the potential to contribute to sustainable and resilient urban communities. This study focuses on analysing the health benefits of UA and attempts to identify old community residents\u2019 attitudes and perceptions towards UA and understand their confusion and worry. The purpose of this study is to promote the healthy and sustainable development of old communities by integrating UA into the micro-transformation of old communities and provide planning and design strategies and community development ideas for the micro-transformation. Surveys were conducted on 10 old communities in Yuexiu district, located in Guangzhou, China. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM Statistical SPSS version 26 to obtain information on the factor structure of residents\u2019 perceptions towards the health benefits of UA. The analysis results showed significant differences between gender groups and the status of children on old community residents\u2019 perceptions towards general UA benefits. The main factors accounting for old community residents\u2019 perceptions towards the health benefits of UA were environmental health benefits, physical and psychological health benefits, and community health benefits. When developing UA in old communities, co-construction and co-sharing mode, public participation mode, and promotion mode are three important development strategies. Construction location, design style, and seasonal design are also critical for the construction of UA in old communities.

Precision Agriculture (PA) is one of the focuses of these policies to optimize the crops and facilitate crop management using technology. Drones have been gaining popularity in PA to perform remote sensing activities such as photo and video capture as well as other activities such as fertilization or scaring animals. These drones could be used as a mobile gateway as well, benefiting from its already designed flight plan. In this paper, we evaluate the adequacy of remote sensing drones to perform gateway functionalities, providing a guide for choosing the best drone parameters for successful WiFi data transmission between sensor nodes and the gateway in PA systems for crop monitoring and management. The novelty of this paper compared with existing mobile gateway proposals is that we are going to test the performance of the drone that is acting as a remote sensing tool to carry a low-cost gateway node to gather the data from the nodes deployed on the field. Taking this in mind, simulations of different scenarios were performed to determine if the data can be transmitted correctly or not considering different flying parameters such as speed (from 1 to 20 m/s) and flying height (from 4 to 104 m) and wireless sensor network parameters such as node density (1 node each 60 m2 to 1 node each 5000 m2) and antenna coverage (25 to 200 m). We have calculated the time that each node remains with connectivity and the time required to send the data to estimate if the connection will be bad, good, or optimal. Results point out that for the maximum node density, there is only one combination that offers good connectivity (lowest velocity, the flying height of 24 m, and antenna with 25 m of coverage). For the other node densities, several combinations of flying height and antenna coverage allows good and optimal connectivity.

The purpose was to help relevant agencies use aerial imaging in managing agricultural production. This study involves five townships in the Chianan Plain of Chiayi County, Taiwan. About 100 ha of farmland in each township was selected as a sample area, and a quadcopter and a handheld fixed-wing drone were used to capture visible-light images and multispectral images. The survey was carried out from August to October 2018 and aerial photographs were captured in clear and dry weather. This study used high-resolution images captured from a UAV to classify the uses of agricultural land, and then employed information from multispectral images and elevation data from a digital surface model. The results revealed that visible-light images led to low interpretation accuracy. However, multispectral images and elevation data increased the accuracy rate to nearly 90%. Accordingly, such images and data can effectively enhance the accuracy of land use classification. The technology can reduce costs that are associated with labor and time and can facilitate the establishment of a real-time mapping database.

A randomized complete block design in a split-split-plot arrangement was used to evaluate the short-term (2012\u20132015) effects of tillage (no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT)), rotation (maize-fallow-maize (MFM); maize-fallow-soybean (MFS); maize-wheat-maize (MWM) and maize-wheat-soybean (MWS)) and residue management (residue removal (R\u2212) and residue retention (R+)) on bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and macroporosity hydraulic conductivity. The interaction of tillage \u00d7 crop rotation \u00d7 residue management was not significant (p > 0.05) with respect to BD, PR, Ks and macroporosity. The MFM rotation had the highest BD (1.40 g cm\u22123), followed by MWM rotation (1.36 g cm\u22123), and the least BD was observed in the MFS rotation (1.29 g cm\u22123). Penetration resistance was significantly higher in CT (2.43 MPa) compared to NT (1.46 MPa). The study concludes that inclusion of MFS and MWS rotations can potentially reduce BD in the short term. Similarly, conversion from CT to NT reduces soil resistance.

Conservation agriculture (CA) has been regarded as an ideal field management strategy to profoundly benefit water use and therefore crop production. However, it remains unclear as to how crop production and water use respond to annual precipitation and how CA practices affect crop production through regulating water use. In this study, a meta-analysis based on field observations was conducted to investigate the relationship between water use and crop production. The results showed that annual precipitation of 300 mm yr\u22121 is a threshold to ensure relatively high crop production and water use efficiency (WUE), and 600 mm yr\u22121 is the most favorable rainfall level for crop production and WUE. Evapotranspiration (ET) was linearly related to annual precipitation, except that it was not the lowest when annual rainfall <300 mm yr\u22121. Although straw mulching is more important than tillage reduction, tillage reduction is still necessary to combine with straw mulching to obtain a higher production of crop. Crop production, ET, and WUE kept increasing as experimental duration increased, indicating that extending CA term is essential to further improve water use and crop production. We further proposed mathematical equations to prove that the increase in transpiration plays a critical role in water use and crop production improvement. WUE is not necessarily related to the increase in yield, and, therefore, higher transpiration rather than increased WUE should be the target for crop production improvement. The results also suggest that evaporation and transpiration are not presented separately, which limits investigation of the effective use of water by identifying transpiration. Overall, annual precipitation is essential for the levels of crop production, ET, and WUE on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Reasonable CA practices, especially long-term application, could improve water use and crop production through increasing transpiration. However, a better future understanding of the relationship between crop production and water use needs more detailed information about the effective use of water at field scales.

This important abiotic stress has worsened in the last 20 years due to the increase in water demands in arid and semi-arid areas. In this context, increasing tolerance of crop plants to salt stress is needed to guarantee future food supply to a growing population. This review compiles knowledge on the use of phytoprotectants of microbial origin (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria), osmoprotectants, melatonin, phytohormones and antioxidant metabolism-related compounds as alleviators of salt stress in numerous plant species. Phytoprotectants are discussed in detail, including their nature, applicability, and role in the plant in terms of physiological and phenotype effects. As a result, increased crop yield and crop quality can be achieved, which in turn positively impact food security. Herein, efforts from academic and industrial sectors should focus on defining the treatment conditions and plant-phytoprotectant associations providing higher benefits.

Naturally-occurring rocks and minerals may help address these challenges. In this case, we explore opportunities through which the geosphere could support viable agricultural systems, primarily via a literature review supplemented by data analysis and preliminary-scale experimentation. Our objective is to focus on opportunities specifically relating to emerging agricultural challenges. Our findings reveal that a spectrum of common geological materials can assist across four key agricultural challenges: 1. Providing environmentally-sustainable fertiliser deposits especially for the two key elements in food production, nitrogen (via use of slow release N-rich clays), and phosphorus (via recovery of the biomineral struvite) as well as through development of formulations to tap into mineral nutrient reserves underlying croplands. 2. Reducing contamination from farms\u2014using clays, zeolites, and hydroxides to intercept, and potentially recycle nutrients discharged from paddocks. 3. Embedding drought resilience into agricultural landscapes by increasing soil moisture retention (using high surface area minerals including zeolite and smectite), boosting plant availability of drought protective elements (using basalts, smectites, and zeolites), and decreasing soil surface temperature (using reflective smectites, zeolites, and pumices), and 4. mitigating emissions of all three major greenhouse gases\u2014carbon dioxide (using fast-weathering basalts), methane (using iron oxides), and nitrous oxide (using nitrogen-sorbing clays). Drawbacks of increased geological inputs into agricultural systems include an increased mining footprint, potential increased loads of suspended sediments in high-rainfall catchments, changes to geo-ecological balances, and possible harmful health effects to practitioners extracting and land-applying the geological materials. Our review highlights potential for \u2018geo-agriculture\u2019 approaches to not only help meet several key emerging challenges that threaten sustainable food and fiber production, but also to contribute to achieving some of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\u2014\u2018Zero Hunger,\u2019 \u2018Life on Land,\u2019 and \u2018Climate Action.\u2019 View Full-Text", "Weed management is one of the main challenges of conservation agriculture. Although all three components of conservation agriculture (minimal tillage, permanent soil cover and crop diversification) can reduce weed populations, these effects may only become apparent in the medium to long term. This study evaluated weed biomass, density and diversity with and without herbicide control in a long-term trial initiated in 1991 in the Mexican Highlands to evaluate all three components of conservation agriculture. Data were collected in 2004, 2005, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Weed density and biomass were generally lower in conservation agriculture than with conventional tillage. The three components of conservation agriculture significantly reduced weed biomass, which was lower when all three components were applied together. When herbicides were applied, weed biomass in conservation agriculture was 91% lower in maize and 81% lower in wheat than in conventional tillage. Different treatments favored different weed species, but no trend toward increased perennial weeds was observed in conservation agriculture. These data supported claims stating that if adequate weed control is achieved in the initial years, weed populations in conservation agriculture systems are lower than in conventional tillage systems.

To address the link between lunar phases and agriculture from a scientific perspective, we conducted a review of textbooks and monographs used to teach agronomy, botany, horticulture and plant physiology; we also consider the physics that address the effects of the Moon on our planet. Finally, we review the scientific literature on plant development, specifically searching for any direct or indirect reference to the influence of the Moon on plant physiology. We found that there is no reliable, science-based evidence for any relationship between lunar phases and plant physiology in any plant\u2013science related textbooks or peer-reviewed journal articles justifying agricultural practices conditioned by the Moon. Nor does evidence from the field of physics support a causal relationship between lunar forces and plant responses. Therefore, popular agricultural practices that are tied to lunar phases have no scientific backing. We strongly encourage teachers involved in plant sciences education to objectively address pseudo-scientific ideas and promote critical thinking.

However, humans possess five basic perceptual systems with accuracy levels that can change from human to human which are largely dependent on the stress, experience, health and age. To overcome this problem, in the last decade, with the help of the emergence of smartphone technology, new agronomic applications were developed to reach better, cost-effective, more accurate and portable diagnosis systems. Conventional smartphones are equipped with several sensors that could be useful to support near real-time usual and advanced farming activities at a very low cost. Therefore, the development of agricultural applications based on smartphone devices has increased exponentially in the last years. However, the great potential offered by smartphone applications is still yet to be fully realized. Thus, this paper presents a literature review and an analysis of the characteristics of several mobile applications for use in smart/precision agriculture available on the market or developed at research level. This will contribute to provide to farmers an overview of the applications type that exist, what features they provide and a comparison between them. Also, this paper is an important resource to help researchers and applications developers to understand the limitations of existing tools and where new contributions can be performed.

To highlight the weed management practices used by farmers in conservation agriculture and the changes induced by its adoption, a large sample of 425 French farmers were invited to complete an online survey. Weed management practices used by farmers were requested for three periods: before adoption, during the first years of conservation agriculture (one to two years after adoption), and when the agricultural system is considered \u201cmastered\u201d by the farmer. The use of each farming practice was firstly studied independently for each period. Then, a multiple correspondence analysis followed by a hierarchical ascendant classification resulted in groups of farmers with different combinations of practices for each period. Finally, the groups of farmers were followed through the periods. Results showed that changes in weed management done according to farmers when adopting and mastering conservation agriculture are multiple and vary according to farmers and their previous weed management. Although some similar choices were identified, some farmers\u2019 trajectories, especially those with a prior combination driven by either a soil disturbance strategy or a crop competitiveness strategy, are difficult to identify when adopting conservation agriculture.

The situation will worsen due to climate change. Regardless of the cause that generated the salinity, i.e., whether primary or secondary, the effect of soil salinization on plant growth and on living organisms will be severe. To mitigate such impacts, several studies have been carried out over the years with the aim of providing technical or management solutions to deal with the multiple consequences of soil salinity. A review by Cuevas et al. proposes a new approach looking for solutions through soil-improving cropping systems (SICSs). The SICSs have to prevent, mitigate or remediate the negative impacts of soil salinization. The efforts of Cuevas et al. were to organize the analyses by focusing on SICSs that would: (1) prevent or halt secondary salinization; (2) cope with salinization; (3) reverse salinization. The study is concluded by an effort to assess the impacts of each SICS and of the combined SICSs application in terms of agronomic, economic, and environmental aspects. Both economic constraints and the collective willingness of stakeholders to innovate are taken into in the evaluation of feasibility. It is important to put into practice and/or identify a number of sustainable actions, at low environmental input, to improve crop tolerance to water deficit and high salinity as well as to preserve biodiversity and mitigate the impact of climate changes. At the same time, these actions would ensure crop productivity in the area, thus guaranteeing environment and social benefits to the local population, and thus weakening the motivation to abandon the land. The aim of this editorial is to propose a broader perspective on the review by Cuevas et al. \u201cA Review of Soil-Improving Cropping Systems for Soil Salinization\u201d. In the review, the authors go through several soil-improving cropping systems (SICSs) by considering them separately or in combination with the aim to provide guidelines towards resolving, counteracting or mitigating soil salinity. I tried to highlight the strengths of the study by Cuevas et al., while suggesting related topics that may deserve further attention by the community.

For the reduction of ammonia emissions, different management steps have been reported in most EU countries. Some authors, however, have criticized such individual measures, because attempts to abate the emission of ammonia may lead to significant increases in either methane, nitrous oxide, or carbon dioxide. In this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of experimental European data published in peer-reviewed journals to evaluate the impact of major agricultural management practices on ammonia emissions, including the pollution swapping effect. The result of our meta-analysis showed that for the treatment, storage, and application stages, only slurry acidification was effective for the reduction of ammonia emissions (\u221269%), and had no pollution swapping effect with other greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide (\u221221%), methane (\u221286%), and carbon dioxide (\u221215%). All other management strategies, like biological treatment, separation strategies, different storage types, the concealing of the liquid slurry with different materials, and variable field applications were effective to varying degrees for the abatement of ammonia emission, but also resulted in the increased emission of at least one other greenhouse gas. The strategies focusing on the decrease of ammonia emissions neglected the consequences of the emissions of other greenhouse gases. We recommend a combination of treatment technologies, like acidification and soil incorporation, and/or embracing emerging technologies, such as microbial inhibitors and slow release fertilizers.

However, scaling limitations exist at the regional level due to big data volumes and processing constraints. Here, we demonstrate the Fusion Approach for Remotely-Sensed Mapping of Agriculture (FARMA), using a suite of open source software capable of efficiently characterizing time-series field-scale statistics across large geographical areas at VHR resolution. We provide distinct implementation examples in Vietnam and Senegal to demonstrate the approach using WorldView VHR optical, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar, and Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 optical imagery. This distributed software is open source and entirely scalable, enabling large area mapping even with modest computing power. FARMA provides the ability to extract and monitor sub-hectare fields with multisensor raster signals, which previously could only be achieved at scale with large computational resources. Implementing FARMA could enhance predictive yield models by delineating boundaries and tracking productivity of smallholder fields, enabling more precise food security observations in low and lower-middle income countries.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the overall efficiency of a vertical subsurface flow system (VSSFs) constructed wetland (CW) operating for the treatment of first-flush stormwater and the effects of treated wastewater on the morphological and aesthetic characteristics of ornamental pepper and rosemary plants. The system had a total surface area of 46.80 m2 and was planted with common reed and giant reed. Wastewater samples were taken from October 2018 to July 2019 at the CW inlet and outlet for chemical-physical and microbiological characterization of the wastewater. Two separate experimental fields of rosemary and ornamental pepper were set up in another Sicilian location. Three sources of irrigation water, two accessions of rosemary and two varieties of ornamental pepper were tested in a split-plot design for a two-factor experiment. The results showed very high organic pollutant removal (BOD5 75\u201383%, COD 65\u201369%) and a good efficiency of nutrients (TN 60\u201366%) and trace metals (especially for Cu and Zn) removal. Escherichia coli concentration levels were always lower than 100 CFU 100 mL\u22121 during the test period. Irrigation water and plant habitus had significant effects on all the morphological and aesthetic characteristics of the plants. For both the crops, plants irrigated with freshwater and treated wastewater had greater growth and showed a better general appearance in comparison with plants irrigated with wastewater. The higher trace metal levels in the wastewater produced adverse effects on plant growth and reduced the visual quality of the plants. Our results suggest the suitability of a VSSFs constructed wetland for the treatment of first-flush stormwater and the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation purposes, in accordance with legislation requirements concerning wastewater quality.

Hence, it is essential to address the question of \u201chow to improve China\u2019s agricultural productivity and efficiency in order to achieve growth and sustainability of agriculture in the future\u201d. This paper estimates indices of China\u2019s agricultural technical efficiency (TE) scores, total-factor productivity (TFP), and its two components, technological change/progress (TC) and technical efficiency change (EC), using provincial-level panel data of 30 provinces from 2002 to 2017 by applying a stochastic frontier approach (SFA). The paper also identifies determinants of TE, TC, and TFP using selected indicators from four hierarchical levels of the economy, i.e., farm level, production environment level, provincial level, and the state level, by applying a system-GMM method. Results reveal that agricultural labor, machinery, agricultural plastic film, and pesticides are the significant drivers of agricultural productivity, with no significant role of land area under cultivation. Constant returns to scale exist in China\u2019s agriculture. The agricultural technical efficiency level fluctuated between 80% and 91% with a stable trend and a slight decline in later years, while TFP improved consistently over time, mainly driven by technological progress. Among the determinants, government investment in agricultural development projects significantly drives TC and TE, while the experienced labor force significantly increases TE. The disaster rate significantly reduces TE but promotes TC and TFP. The literacy rate significantly improves TC and TFP. However, government expenditures in \u201cagriculture, forestry, and water\u201d significantly reduce TE, TC, and TFP. Policy recommendations include (1) increased levels of mechanization and agriculture film use while avoiding an increase in pesticide use, (2) a continued increase in government expenditure in agricultural development projects, R&D to improve technological progress, and diffusion of modern agricultural technologies, and (3) investment in education targeted at the farming population in order to continue the growth in the productivity and sustainability of China\u2019s agriculture.

The main obstacle is that a large part of the water used in agriculture is unmetered. The objective of this study is to assess the Water Authorities (WA)\u2019s choices between different options of incentive pricing policies (IPP) and to evaluate their economic performance compared with flat rate (FR) solutions. The applied method relies on a principal-agent model under adverse selection, in which WAs are less informed than farmers about the water use costs and profits. In this respect, the paper provides a theoretical interpretation of how different information conditions, profit and cost structures contribute to affecting WAs\u2019 pricing strategies and their ability to deal with some of the WFD principles. The study shows that, in the absence of water metering, WAs can still set up incentive pricing strategies by formulating menus of contracts that are more efficient than flat rate payments. Also, we show that, at least for cases in which there is only a small differentiation in water costs among farmers or no transaction costs, the first-best solution (the solution that yields the highest return from the use of the resource) can also be optimal under asymmetric information. The main policy recommendation is that, in the absence of water metering, a wider set of incentive pricing options should be considered, the performance of which, however, should be evaluated based on the specificities of each irrigated region.

Dealing with food security requires more attention to how to protect peri-urban organic farming systems from urban pressures while strengthening the sustainability of local food systems. Given that short food supply chains (SFSCs) have been proven to be effective at reconnecting people with food production, this study focuses on identifying the barriers that hinder their development and the opportunities derived from the comparative advantage provided by their urban proximity. This study is based on documentary and empirical research addressing food supply chain characteristics in the organic sector. This study is focused on Mediterranean peri-urban agriculture, where, historically, there have been close relationships between the city and the countryside. These relationships are based on the fact that many cities are traditionally located next to areas of high agricultural activity, where a wide variety of vegetables is produced almost continuously due to the relatively mild winter climate.

While advances in the application of geospatial information systems and remote sensing technologies offer much to agriculture, capturing and using that rich spatial biophysical information is not a feature available in most farm systems models. In this paper, we tackle this gap describing a land-based integrated grazing farm optimisation and resource allocation model (AgInform\u00ae) that departs from the use of whole farm and average data, to the integration of biological data obtained directly from each of the land units within the farm. The model allows the exploration of the dynamics of biophysical and financial performance of the farm in a steady-state, single-year approach, where the opening and closing values of the biological elements of the farm system conditions must remain the same (e.g., animal numbers, herbage mass), unless otherwise specified. The user supplies pasture growth rates, minimum and maximum acceptable pasture masses for each land management unit (LMU), differential boundary conditions to deliver defined environmental outcomes, animal performance (sheep, beef and deer), farm costs and market prices. The linear programming (LP) equations formed by AgInform\u00ae can be divided into a single objective and constraints (which accommodate the boundaries), including those placed on individual LMUs. The optimization routine uses this information to identify the mix of livestock production enterprises that maximises profit for the business. The model in maintaining the link between available pasture mass and livestock requirements for each LMU throughout all calculations, enables the livestock type and number carried, along with the pasture mass required on each LMU throughout the year to achieve the required animal performance levels to be included as model outputs. A hill land sheep and beef farm consisting of seven distinct LMUs was used as a farm-level case to assess if AgInform\u00ae (1) has sufficient flexibility to integrate biological information from each LMU; (2) could use the specified livestock performance targets to derive a feasible livestock policy that optimised resource use and farm returns; (3) can assign each fortnight animal type and number and herbage mass to each LMU; and (4) can mimic reality to produce credible solutions.

The present study aimed to quantify the potential nutrient production of urban agricultural vegetables and the resulting nutritional self-sufficiency throughout the year for mitigating post-disaster situations. Methods: We estimated the vegetable production of urban agriculture throughout the year. Two methods were developed to capture the production from professional and hobby farms: Method I utilized secondary governmental data on agricultural production from professional farms, and Method II was based on a supplementary spatial analysis to estimate the production from hobby farms. Next, the weight of produced vegetables [t] was converted into nutrients [kg]. Furthermore, the self-sufficiency by nutrient and time of year was estimated by incorporating the reference consumption of vegetables [kg], recommended dietary allowance of nutrients per capita [mg], and population statistics. The research was conducted in Nerima, the second most populous ward of Tokyo\u2019s 23 special wards. Self-sufficiency rates were calculated with the registered residents. Results: The estimated total vegetable production of 5660 tons was equivalent to a weight-based self-sufficiency rate of 6.18%. The average nutritional self-sufficiencies of Methods I and II were 2.48% and 0.38%, respectively, resulting in an aggregated average of 2.86%. Fluctuations throughout the year were observed according to the harvest seasons of the available crops. Vitamin K (6.15%) had the highest self-sufficiency of selected nutrients, while calcium had the lowest (0.96%). Conclusions: This study suggests that depending on the time of year, urban agriculture has the potential to contribute nutrients to diets during post-disaster situations as disaster preparedness food. Emergency responses should be targeted according to the time of year the disaster takes place to meet nutrient requirements in periods of low self-sufficiency and prevent gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiovascular diseases among survivors.

Almost all the analyzed works use the feedforward architecture, while the recurrent and hybrid networks are little exploited in the various tasks of the greenhouses. Throughout the document, different network training techniques are presented, where the feasibility of using optimization models for the learning process is exposed. The advantages and disadvantages of neural networks (NNs) are observed in the different applications in greenhouses, from microclimate prediction, energy expenditure, to more specific tasks such as the control of carbon dioxide. The most important findings in this work can be used as guidelines for developers of smart protected agriculture technology, in which systems involve technologies 4.0.

New forms of urban agriculture are observed such as rooftop farming. In the case of low-tech rooftop farming projects, based on recycled urban waste, one of the key issues is the type of substrate used, as it determines the functions and ecosystem services delivered by the green roof. Using a five year experimental trial, we quantified the food production potential of Technosols created only with urban wastes (green waste compost, crushed wood, spent mushroom), as well as the soil fertility and the potential contamination of food products. Regarding food production, our cropping system showed promising results across the five years, in relation with the high fertility of the Technosols. This fertility was maintained, as well as the nutrients stocks after five cropping years. Most of the edible crops had trace metals contents below existing norms for toxic trace metals with nevertheless a concern regarding certain some trace metals such as Zn and Cu. There was no trace metal accumulation in the Technosols over time except for Zn. This study confirmed that constructing Technosols only from urban wastes is a suitable and efficient solution to design rooftops for edible production.

Therefore, smart and efficient farming techniques are necessary to improve agriculture productivity. Agriculture land suitability assessment is one of the essential tools for agriculture development. Several new technologies and innovations are being implemented in agriculture as an alternative to collect and process farm information. The rapid development of wireless sensor networks has triggered the design of low-cost and small sensor devices with the Internet of Things (IoT) empowered as a feasible tool for automating and decision-making in the domain of agriculture. This research proposes an expert system by integrating sensor networks with Artificial Intelligence systems such as neural networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the assessment of agriculture land suitability. This proposed system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture land for cultivation in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable. This assessment is determined based on the input collected from the various sensor devices, which are used for training the system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden layers is found to be effective for the multiclass classification system when compared to the other existing model. This trained model will be used for evaluating future assessments and classifying the land after every cultivation.

In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties\u2019 mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.

As a traditional agricultural country, China has experienced a series of problems such as a serious waste of resources and a fragile ecological environment during its agricultural economic development. With the background of \u201cthe Belt and Road Initiative\u201d, major progress has been witnessed in both ecological development and agricultural circular economy in China. However, the development of circular agriculture in China has to deal with barriers from different stakeholders. This research identifies critical barriers for the government, farmers, and the enterprises to develop circular agriculture. The causal factors, effect factors, and the center of factors are identified and the correlation between the barriers is described using the Gray-DEMATEL method. Based on the analysis results, several policy suggestions are proposed for the government. This paper provides a feasible framework for decision-making to support the development of a sustainable circular economy in agriculture in China.

Hence, bacterial diseases affecting either agricultural crops, fish, or shellfish not only cause large economic losses to producers but can even create food shortages, resulting in malnutrition, or even famine, in vulnerable populations. Years of antibiotic use in the prevention and the treatment of these infections have greatly contributed to the emergence and the proliferation of multidrug-resistant bacteria. This review addresses the urgent need for alternative strategies for the use of antibiotics, focusing on the use of bacteriophages (phages) as biocontrol agents. Phages are viruses that specifically infect bacteria; they are highly host-specific and represent an environmentally-friendly alternative to antibiotics to control and kill pathogenic bacteria. The information evaluated here highlights the effectiveness of phages in the control of numerous major pathogens that affect both agriculture and aquaculture, with special emphasis on scientific and technological aspects still requiring further development to establish phagotherapy as a real universal alternative to antibiotic treatment.

Therefore, understanding how farmers in diverse agroclimatic zones perceive and respond to different conservation practices is important to the implementation of sustainable agriculture practices (SAPs). To this end, this study uses a best\u2013worst scaling approach to examine the adoption preferences for nine SAPs among grain and cash crop farmers and investigates the influence of farm and climatic characteristics on adoption preferences based on a face to face survey of 554 households in Gansu province, which is classified as an arid and semiarid area in northwest China. Both grain and cash crop farmers had stronger preferences for the practices of using organic instead of chemical fertilizers and of improving irrigation practices. In addition, while cash crop farmers also had strong preferences for cover crop-related practices, they preferred long-term fallows least. Household income, livestock, and precipitation influence the potential perceived importance of SAPs. The different perceived importance of these practices suggests new possible combinations or packages for a sustainable agriculture program during the cropping structure adjustment in Gansu.

However, soil degradation and uneven distribution of rainfall have threatened agriculture at present. This study is aimed at investigating the impacts of conservation agriculture on irrigation water use, nutrient availability in the root zone, and crop yield under supplementary irrigation. In this study, conservation agriculture (CA), which includes minimum soil disturbance, grass mulch cover, and crop rotation, was practiced and compared with conventional tillage (CT). We used two years\u2019 (2018 and 2019) experimental data under paired-t design in the production of a local variety green pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). The results showed that CA practices significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) reduced irrigation water use (13% to 29%) and runoff (29% to 51%) while it increased percolated water in the root zone (27% to 50%) when compared with CT practices under the supplementary irrigation phase. In addition, CA significantly decreased NO3-N in the leachate (14% to 44%) and in the runoff (about 100%), while PO4-P significantly decreased in the leachate (33% to 50%) and in the runoff (16%) when compared with CT. Similarly, CA decreased the NO3-N load in the leachate and in the runoff, while the PO4-P load increased in the leachate but decreased in the runoff. The yield return that was achieved under CA treatment was 30% higher in 2018 and 10% higher in 2019 when compared with the CT. This research improves our understanding of water and nutrient dynamics in green pepper grown under CA and CT. Use of CA provides opportunities to optimize water use by decreasing irrigation water requirements and optimize nutrient use by decreasing nutrient losses through the runoff and leaching.

Some of the multiple profits of developing new agricultural technologies and applications include the cost reduction around the building and deployment of them, together with more energy-efficient consumption. Therefore, agricultural precision systems focus on developing better, easier, cheaper, and overall more efficient ways of handling agricultural monitoring and actuation. To achieve this vision, we use a set of technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks, Sensors devices, Internet of Things, or data analysis. More specifically, in this study, we proposed a combination of all these technologies to design and develop a prototype of a precision agriculture system for medium and small agriculture plantations that highlights two major advantages: efficient energy management with self-charging capabilities and a low-cost policy. For the development of the project, several prototype nodes were built and deployed within a sensor network connected to the cloud as a self-powered system. The final target of this system is, therefore, to gather environment data, analyze it, and actuate by activating the watering installation.

The main goals of ECOWAP/CAADP were set to promote agriculture development and end hunger by 2025. In this study we focused on the Cabo Verde archipelago as one of the best performing countries within ECOWAS in terms of overall sustainable development. In this paper, the evolution of the ECOWAP implementation and of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) associated with agriculture in Cabo Verde, were assessed by semi-quantitative (e.g., agricultural policies, agrarian periodical literature) and quantitative (modeling regression of ECOWAP implementation and Sustainable Development Goals\u2014SDGs\u2014performance) analyses. Our integrated results suggest that the agriculture development strategies, the signature of ECOWAP/CAADP by the national government, and political stability might explain the progress made towards poverty reduction and the improvement of food security. The results also show that agriculture-related SDGs in Cabo Verde are higher than the mean values obtained from the remaining West African countries, well above the top 25% WA countries. Nevertheless, Cabo Verde public expenditure into agriculture under the ECOWAP was generally below the targeted 10% of the national budget, with food import required to meet internal food demands.

These devices expand the possibilities in many areas, like agriculture and urban spaces. In this work, we consider an IoT environment for monitoring a coffee plantation in precision agriculture. We investigate the energy consumption under low-power and lossy networks considering three different network topologies and an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standardized Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) routing protocol, the Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL). For RPL, each secondary node selects a better parent according to some Objective Functions (OFs). We conducted simulations using Contiki Cooja 3.0, where we considered the Expected Transmission Count (ETX) and hop-count metric (HOP) metrics to evaluate energy consumption for three distinct topologies: tree, circular, and grid. The simulation results show that the circular topology had the best (lowest) energy consumption, being 15% better than the grid topology and 30% against the tree topology. The results help the need to improve the evolution of RPL metrics and motivate the network management of the topology.

The following research tasks were formulated: analysis of employment levels and GVA in the sectors of economy in 2000 and 2018 as well as the relationship between employment and GVA, assessment of GVA per 1 person employed in the investigated sectors and its changes in the analysed years, and assessment of the scale of surplus employment in agriculture assuming that GVA per 1 person employed in this sector would be equal to the average level reached in the industry and the services sectors. Comparative analysis and the deduction method were used in the study. Correlation coefficients between the level of employment in individual sectors and GVA per 1 person employed in the time series covering the years 2000\u20132008 were also calculated. A new measure of the \u201cgoal\u201d of employment reduction in agriculture has been proposed, related to the measurement of the distance between agriculture and other sectors in terms of GVA generated per 1 employed\u2014the Excess Employment Rate In The Agricultural Sector (EERAS). The research was based on EUROSTAT data from the years of 2000 and 2018. The process of changes in the sectoral structure of employment will probably be determined by the growth rate of demand for services, structural adjustment referring to matching the characteristics of the agricultural population to the demand for labour force in the services sector and the pace of structural transformations in rural areas. Rationalisation of employment levels in agriculture promotes improvement of its economic and social sustainability. Instruments based on financial transfers from nonagricultural sectors to agriculture should play a secondary role, since they are a burden to more efficient sectors, and in the long term, they may hinder reduction of employment in agriculture. However, due to the inevitable differences in productivity observed between agriculture and the nonagricultural sectors, at a technologically, economically, ecologically and socially justified level of employment in agriculture, transfers of the surplus generated in the secondary and tertiary sectors need at least to reduce, if not eliminate, economic consequences of these differences.

Locally embedded farms and bottom-linked approaches such as social cooperatives that act in the field of social agriculture are small, but valuable models to counteract these trends. This article is based on a case study conducted within the transdisciplinary research and development project Unlocking the Potential of Social Agriculture (UPAS), 2017\u20132020\u2014financed by the Free University of Bolzano. The main focus of the case study is to determine the impact of social agriculture initiatives on social and healthcare systems, the natural environment and the communities in which they act. Data collection includes a literature review, observations and interviews carried out on 35 case studies of social agriculture initiatives, mainly located in Italy. The field research points out that actors in the sector of social agriculture predominantly aim to integrate disadvantaged people socially and in terms of their labor, base their production on organic methods, and that social agriculture has the potential to foster eco-social transformation and development of rural areas by the combination of social and ecological concerns. Thus, we use the term \u201ceco-social\u201d agriculture to describe these approaches. Furthermore, five components of eco-social agriculture have been defined, which, together, offer an ideal set of acting principles, namely: (1) the empowerment and integration of disadvantaged people, (2) the promotion of environmentally friendly agricultural practices, (3) the protection of nature, resources and cultural landscape, (4) support to the local community, and (5) education for sustainable development.

Alternatives like urban agriculture have emerged to reduce the negative social, environmental and health impacts of industrial agriculture. Such new food supply chains can change the way that people acquire and process food. This study looks at high-tech indoor gardening practices in nursing homes for elderly people, studying four nursing homes in the Dutch city of Velp. We used both qualitative and quantitative approaches to collect data, using site visits, a survey amongst employees, and semi-structured interviewees with residents and decision makers. Inspired by social practice theory, we aimed to understand the transformation of existing practices, investigating how the gardens affect cooking and eating practices, and how their constitutive elements of meaning, material and competences enable these transformations. Our work shows that the indoor gardens resulted in an integration of gardening and the resulting harvest into cooking practices, which in turn transformed residents\u2019 eating practices. Appreciation of the taste of fresh vegetables and appearance of the meal decorated by fresh vegetables, as well as observing the growth of plants and their use, holds value for the elderly residents. Employees welcome the possibility to serve healthier meals. The integration of indoor gardens in existing cooking practices is more successful when employees have gardening and/or cooking competences, when they enjoy cooking and when they do not already cook with fresh ingredients. The gardens are more easily integrated when they are easily accessible. The materiality of the gardens does not require fully equipped kitchens.

However, in leisure agriculture management, managers must consider the dual characteristics of agricultural production technology and the leisure service industry. Therefore, managers often face various selection pressures during management decision-making. This study examined the following five evaluation aspects: organization and operation, leisure agricultural resources, environmental maintenance management, public facility maintenance management, and operational performance. Thereafter, according to the five evaluation aspects, 21 subprojects were further divided at the second level on the basis of different attributes. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was adopted to calculate the relative weights of various indicators, and the indicators were dynamically sorted according to their importance. Moreover, the study summarized the dynamic management indicators of leisure agriculture and contributed to research on leisure farming. The results show that managers\u2019 approach toward leisure agriculture management can be divided into three types: active, moderate, and conservative. The indicators in which the active managers attach importance when managing leisure agricultural enterprises are clearly different from those valued by moderate and conservative managers. Finding managers who are suitable for leisure agriculture management is of great significance to leisure agriculture enterprises. Appointing managers with appropriate attitudes who can continuously improve the efficiency of enterprises and create a competitive advantage can bring sustainable business value to these enterprises.

The study area in northern Bangladesh included two union council areas under the Panchagarh sub-district. Climatological data analysis, a detailed questionnaire survey, and focus group discussions were conducted to assess farmers\u2019 perceptions regarding the shifting and identification of hazards, their seasonal variation, and hazard prioritizations. The SMUG (seriousness, manageability, urgency, and growth) and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) models were applied for hazard prioritization. Hailstorms were found to be the most prioritized hazard over droughts and flash floods as perceived by the community. The farmers\u2019 perceptions as evaluated through a questionnaire survey also support the findings of the SMUG and FEMA models. This was the first attempt to analyze the potential of hailstorms as a significant hazard in Bangladesh, and GIS maps showed their spatial distribution and temporal frequency across Bangladesh. This newly identified hazard is significantly diminishing farmers\u2019 motivation to continue farming and has the potential to affect sustainable agriculture. The farmers\u2019 perceptions, historical data analysis, use of the two models, institutional approach, hazard risk assessment, and vulnerability to the major sectors show that hailstorms should be considered as an important hazard in northern Bangladesh, and policymakers should pay urgent attention to minimize the threat to sustainable agriculture in northern Bangladesh.

Urban and peri-urban agricultural land is often seen as available space for the city to expand, but at the same time, agricultural land provides many benefits to cities pertaining to food, employment, and eco-services. In this context, there is an urgent need to provide spatial information to support planning in complex urban systems. The challenge is to integrate analysis of agriculture and urban land-cover classes, and of their spatial and functional patterns. This paper takes up this challenge in Antananarivo (Madagascar), where agricultural plots and homes are interlocked and very small. It innovates by using a methodology already tested in rural settings, but never applied to urban environments. The key step of the analysis is to produce landscape zoning based on multisource satellite data to identify agri-urban functional areas within the city, and to explore their relationships. Our results demonstrate that the proposed classification method is well suited for mapping agriculture and urban land cover (overall accuracy = 76.56% for the 20 classes of level 3) in such a complex setting. The systemic analysis of urban agriculture patterns and functions can help policymakers and urban planners to design and build resilient cities.

Quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to the research, namely: descriptive statistical and economic analysis of the Polish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data and Statistics Poland data, as well as case studies of organic food producers, covering the years 2005\u20132019. Indicated information sources, encompassing long time span of analysis and various data collections, allowed presenting the complementary picture of eco-innovations at the sector and farm levels. The research examined the different types of ecological innovations in Polish agriculture, including: (1) organisational innovations with an institutional background (e.g., the organic farming support and greening mechanism of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)\u2014implemented in the family farming sector); and (2) the product, marketing, process and organisational innovations in selected organic farms that were individual farmers\u2019 initiatives. On the one hand, the research documented the effectiveness of new agricultural policy solutions in the agricultural sector that are examples of organisational eco-innovations. During 2005\u20132016, the certification system, as well as policy support, contributed to the development of organic farms in Poland in terms of the growth in the share of this type of holdings in total (from 0.5% to 4.6%) and in the overall utilised agricultural area (UAA) (from 0.3% to 3.7%). Moreover, during 2014\u20132015, as a result of the greening in agricultural holdings, the area sown with pulses and papilionaceous, i.e., crops improving soil structure and protecting soils, rose by 174% and 161%, respectively. On the other hand, the case studies conducted showed that the food producers\u2019 knowledge and skills combined with a favourable local economic and social situation, as well as institutional support, played a key role in the process of the emergence of eco-innovations. Among those factors, the respondents\u2019 individual characteristics associated with attitudes towards farming and the social, human and physical capital passed on by family members should be highlighted. This paper contributes to existing literature in two ways. First, this study combines both quantitative and qualitative (including in-depth interviews) approaches to eco-innovations at the micro and macro level of analysis. Second, by differentiating two approaches to ecological innovations, namely the conventional and the sustainable, the article indicates and considers the key factors favourable to the latter.

The new century enhanced the calls for economic diversification, with the agricultural, manufacturing, and services sectors amongst those pronounced. This article focused on the role of agriculture in supporting the economy, particularly, the effect of agriculture on economic growth. The data analyzed was reviewed for the period 1983\u20132017. The ARDL Bounds Test was applied in order to meet the said objectives. The ECM results suggest that agriculture, manufacturing, services, and mining converge to an equilibrium and affect economic growth at the speed of adjustment of 90.6%, with the effect from agriculture, mining, and services being significant. The impact of agriculture on economic growth was significant in both the short-run and long-run, with coefficient unit effects of 0.428 and 0.342, respectively. The effects are strong because more than two-thirds of the rural population rely on farming, and agriculture has stood as a catalyst for food security. For the effect of agriculture to be much more profound, farmers must be supported with adequate infrastructure, accessibility to markets, farming inputs, better irrigation techniques, which would address the problem of reliance on rain, all of which were inconsistent in the last decade.

Overall, the world agricultural TFP grew at a rate of 0.44% p.a. This growth was mainly contributed to by technological progress and mix efficiency changes, while the contributions of technical efficiency and scale efficiency changes were negligible. TFP growth varied across regions, with South Asia at the top of the list (1.05% p.a.), and East Asia and the Pacific (0.18% p.a.) at the bottom. TFP components exerted differential influences amongst regions. For instance, mix efficiency played a dominant role in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, whereas it was technical efficiency change in Latin America and the Caribbean region.

Based on the data of 2012 and 2016, with a projection to 2020, the empirical results reveal that agricultural production, which is considered as Vietnam\u2019s comparative advantage, is insignificantly protected. From the year 2012 to 2016, the effective rate of protection declined for primary agriculture and its supporting sectors, and would become negative by 2020. This implies that Vietnamese farmers are at a disadvantage due to the effect of trade liberalization. Furthermore, it is empirically revealed that the primary agricultural sector has a high value-added multiplier, which means a significant contribution to the domestic economy, is not protected by the government\u2019s tax and tariff policies. Based on the study results, the authors suggest some policy recommendations to improve the situation, which are focused on the reduction of the value-added tax rate on inputs, while making industries with a high spillover effect to the domestic economy a key priority.

As climate change conditions continue to develop, we anticipate more frequent occurrences of abiotic stresses such as drought, high temperature and salinity. Living plants, which are sessile beings, are more exposed to environmental extremes. However, plants are equipped with biosynthetic machinery operating to supply thousands of bio-compounds required for maintaining internal homeostasis. In addition to chemical coordination within a plant, these compounds have the potential to assist plants in tolerating, resisting and escaping biotic and abiotic stresses generated by the external environment. Among certain biosynthates, flavonoids are an important example of these stress mitigators. Flavonoids are secondary metabolites and biostimulants; they play a key role in plant growth by inducing resistance against certain biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, the function of flavonoids as signal compounds to communicate with rhizosphere microbes is indispensable. In this review, the significance of flavonoids as biostimulants, stress mitigators, mediators of allelopathy and signaling compounds is discussed. The chemical nature and biosynthetic pathway of flavonoid production are also highlighted.

The study was carried out in the years 2014\u20132017 in the experimental organic farm of the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation\u2013State Research Institute in Pulawy (Poland). The highest-yielding varieties under organic conditions were Pizarro and Subito. Borowik cultivar showed the highest competitive ability against weeds. The highest number of weeds was found in the Leontyno cultivar, which was connected to the lowest plant density, the lowest weight of the above-ground parts of the canopy and smaller value of tillering coefficient. The most affected by the fungal pathogens Drechslera tritici-repentis (Died.) Shoem. and Puccinia striiformis Schwein. were Fredro and Algoso. Cluster analyses indicated that the most useful cultivars for cultivation in the organic system were: Borowik, Subito, and Tomko, which all showed higher yielding potential, bigger competitiveness against weeds, and average resistance against fungal pathogens. Pizarro, Tulus, and Twingo, which showed high resistance to fungal pathogens with lower competitiveness to weeds, were classified to the second group of usefulness. The least useful for the organic system were: Algoso, Fredro, Grenado, and Leontyno.

Drought causes oxidative stress on plants, arising from excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inadequate CO2, which disrupts the photosynthetic machinery of plants. The use of conventional methods for the development of drought-tolerant crops is time-consuming, and the full adoption of modern biotechnology for crop enhancement is still regarded with prudence. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could be used as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly approach for enhancing crop growth under environmental stress. The various direct and indirect mechanisms used for plant growth enhancement by PGPR were discussed. Synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane\u22121-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase enhances plant nutrient uptake by breaking down plant ACC, thereby preventing ethylene accumulation, and enable plants to tolerate water stress. The exopolysaccharides produced also improves the ability of the soil to withhold water. PGPR enhances osmolyte production, which is effective in reducing the detrimental effects of ROS. Multifaceted PGPRs are potential candidates for biofertilizer production to lessen the detrimental effects of drought stress on crops cultivated in arid regions. This review proffered ways of augmenting their efficacy as bio-inoculants under field conditions and highlighted future prospects for sustainable agricultural productivity.

In this context, this study investigates how consumers\u2019 psychological (i.e., attitudes and social norms) and socio-economic characteristics affect their willingness to pay (WTP) for sustainable agricultural products. To this end, the study incorporates attitude and social norms as components of the theory of reasoned action into the contingent valuation method, thereby establishing an estimation model for consumers\u2019 WTP. Based on an online market survey of adults in South Korea from June to July 2018, the results show that consumers\u2019 attitudes and social norms positively affect WTP for the rice and loach produced through integrated agriculture\u2013aquaculture (IAA). However, the variables in the model affect consumers\u2019 WTP differently, depending on the type of IAA product. For IAA rice, both socio-economic (e.g., income) and psychological variables affect WTP. However, in the case of IAA loach, only social norms are statistically significant in affecting consumers\u2019 WTP.

Precision Agriculture (PA) along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the main drivers of automation in the agriculture domain. PA uses specific sensors and software to ensure that the crops receive exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the sensors deployed in the fields. High-resolution images of crops are obtained from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned or unmanned), which are further processed to extract information used to provide future decisions. In this paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain is presented along with several considerations and challenges. This survey includes wireless communication technologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms used to obtain spectral images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral images and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a case study showing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an IoT-based smart solution for crop health monitoring, which is comprised of two modules. The first module is a wireless sensor network-based system to monitor real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude remote sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed to classify healthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained using a case study and list the challenges and future directions based on our work.

Basic essentials such as food, beverages, clothes and domestic materials are enriched by the agricultural industry. However, the traditional method in agriculture cultivation is labor-intensive and inadequate to meet the accelerating nature of human demands. This scenario raises the need to explore state-of-the-art crop cultivation and harvesting technologies. In this regard, optics and photonics technologies have proven to be effective solutions. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of three photonic techniques, namely imaging, spectroscopy and spectral imaging, in a comparative manner for agriculture applications. Essentially, the spectral imaging technique is a robust solution which combines the benefits of both imaging and spectroscopy but faces the risk of underutilization. This review also comprehends the practicality of all three techniques by presenting existing examples in agricultural applications. Furthermore, the potential of these techniques is reviewed and critiqued by looking into agricultural activities involving palm oil, rubber, and agro-food crops. All the possible issues and challenges in implementing the photonic techniques in agriculture are given prominence with a few selective recommendations. The highlighted insights in this review will hopefully lead to an increased effort in the development of photonics applications for the future agricultural industry.

However, impetuous agricultural expansion and poor resource management (e.g., over-irrigation, inefficient techniques) over the past decades have raised a number of challenges. In this exploratory study, we introduce an open access GIS-based model to help answer selected timely questions related to the agriculture, water and energy nexus in the region. First, the model uses spatial and tabular data to identify the location and extent of irrigated cropland. Then, it employs spatially explicit climatic datasets and mathematical formulation to estimate water and electricity requirements for groundwater irrigation in all identified locations. Finally, it evaluates selected supply options to meet the electricity demand and suggests the least-cost configuration in each location. Results indicate that full irrigation in the basin requires ~3.25 billion million m3 per year. This translates to ~730 GWh of electricity. Fossil fuels do provide the least-cost electricity supply option due to lower capital and subsidized operating costs. Hence, to improve the competitiveness of renewable technologies (RT) (i.e., solar), a support scheme to drop the capital cost of RTs is critically needed. Finally, moving towards drip irrigation can lead to ~47% of water abstraction savings in the NWSAS area.

The results determined that the entrepreneurial commitment and communication aspects of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) considerably affected the conviction dimension of AEI, whereas entrepreneurial commitment, communication ESE, entrepreneurial attitude, planning ESE, and neuroticism notably influenced the preparation dimension of AEI. Furthermore, the effects of neuroticism on entrepreneurial conviction were weaker in younger farmers than in older farmers, and the effects of entrepreneurial commitment, entrepreneurial attitude, neuroticism, and planning ESE on entrepreneurial preparation in younger farmers were different from those in older farmers. Moreover, length of agricultural engagement exhibited an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship with AEIs. The present study contributes to the understanding of how younger farmers\u2019 AEIs can be shaped and how they may cope with the differences they may have compared with older family members.

However, social factors can also play a role. We aimed to clarify how the cropping system is maintained through examining sociocultural factors, specifically land tenure and marriage systems, in an agricultural community in rural mountainous Africa. Several surveys based on participatory observation accompanied by home stays were conducted to determine people who participated in cropping systems and to understand which social system maintained the cropping system. We found that around 70% of target households in Kiboguwa village cultivated three staple crops (maize, cassava and rice) using the same cropping system and almost no farmers outside the village used the village\u2019s sloped fields, meaning that the villagers maintained the cropping system. Households acquired nearby sloped fields by various means such as inheriting land through maternal lineage of household heads or wives. We observed virilocal and uxorilocal residence at similar degrees\u2014and if either the husband or wife was from outside the village, that household would also have fields outside the village. However, nearly 80% of marriages were intravillage and villagers predominantly used fields located within the village limits regardless of the residence type, which helped maintain the cropping system.

In this research, a stratified random sampling method was used to survey 350 maize farmers in four different agro-ecological regions in Bangladesh. Using the multivariate probit model, this study explored the possible correlation between farmers\u2019 perceptions of catastrophic risks and their attitudes towards risk sources\u2014as well as the possible correlation between contract farming, diversification and precautionary savings as risk management strategies. The results confirm the relevance of risk management adoption decisions and reveal that the use of one risk management tool may simultaneously influence the use of another risk management tool. In addition, the research results also show that age, education level, extension experience, monthly household income, farming areas, land ownership and risk aversion nature are the most important factors that affect the adoption of risk management strategies. The research results provide further explanation and information and provide a platform for decision-makers to predict appropriate risk management strategies.

Vegetable production is labor intensive and prone to pests and diseases. Conservation agriculture (CA) and integrated pest management (IPM) practices provide options to increase yields and minimize the use of chemical pesticides. We compared integration of CA and IPM practices (improved alternative system) with farmers\u2019 traditional practice (conventional system) under replicated on-farm tests in four different locations (Lalitpur, Banke, Surkhet, and Dadeldhura) in Nepal. Data on yield, benefit\u2013cost ratio (B:C), labor requirement, insect and disease infestation, and pesticide sprays on five major vegetable crops (tomato, cucumber, bitter gourd, cabbage, cauliflower) were measured. In tomatoes, cucumbers, and bitter gourds, the improved alternative system produced a significantly higher yield, greater benefit-cost ratio, reduced labor, decreased the infestation of pests and diseases, and required fewer pesticidal sprays. Average yield and net income were superior in cabbages and cauliflowers, but nonsignificant. Improved alternative system for all the vegetables were sprayed significantly fewer times than the conventional system. Overall, the improved alternative system for vegetable crops contributed not only to the improved income and livelihoods of people, but also can improve environment and human health due to the reduced use of pesticides. Further research on scaling these improved alternative practices through appropriate farmer organizations, and government and non-government actors can enhance the adoption of CA and IPM practices by smallholder vegetable producers.

The M-R model was employed to construct an integrated model of the influence of consumer landscape on pro-environment behavior and loyalty in organic agricultural tourism. The research framework and questionnaire design were constructed on the basis of literature review and 417 valid questionnaires which were collected from tourists in Eastern Taiwan (Hualien and Taidong). SPSS was employed to analyze the reliability and validity of the questionnaire and LISREL software was used to identify the influence path between variables. The results showed that: 1. The tourists\u2019 cognition of consumer landscape will positively affect the environmental intimacy and environmental identity. 2. Tourists\u2019 environmental intimacy and environmental identity will increase their pro-environmental behavior. 3. Tourists\u2019 pro-environment behavior has a positive impact on their loyalty to organic agricultural tourism. The results show that organic agricultural tourism can stimulate tourists to understand the significance, importance and multiple values of the environment, and increase the intimacy and identity of tourists to the environment, which has a great effect on pro-environment behavior and loyalty. At the same time, it also shows that organic agricultural tourism is a sustainable tourism mode, which is worth promoting.

By the time \u2018land\u2019 animals arrived on the scene, terrestrial plants were plentiful and varied, and herbivorous diets developed in concert with the food sources most commonly available. However, skip forward several hundred millennia, and with the advent of agriculture, approximately 10,000 years ago, dietary diversity began to change. Today, the world is experiencing increasingly higher rates of debilitating, non-communicable diseases\u2014might there be a connection? This paper reviews scientific evidence for the judicious use of various seaweeds in the reduction of heat stress, enhanced immunity, improved growth performance, and methane reduction in animals. The extensive, (super) prebiotic effects of selected macroalgae will also be highlighted. Key studies conducted across the animal kingdom provide considerable support that there is an overwhelming need for the guided and wise applications of increased usage of selected seaweeds in feed, food and supplements. Particular attention will be paid to the bioactive components, and nutraceutical qualities, of various seaweeds, i.e., the brown, Saccharina (Laminaria) spp. and Ascophyllum nodosum, and the red alga Chondrus crispus.

This article focuses on biodegradable and synthetic plastics used in farms as mulching materials and shade materials/greenhouse covering materials (shade nets and plastic films) to protect plants from pests and extreme weather. The sustainability was determined by three factors, carbon footprint from cradle to the end of life (LCA), durability (resistance to photo-oxidation and high tensile strength), and affordability. The LCA analyses showed that the production of polyethylene (PE) requires less energy and generates low quantities of greenhouse gas equivalents. Beyond the LCA data, biodegradable polymers are sustainable based on biodegradability and compostability, ability to suppress weeds, control soil temperatures, and moisture, and augment fertigation and drip irrigation. However, existing technologies are a limiting factor because lab-based innovations have not been commercialized. In addition, industrial production of shade nets, plastic greenhouse covers, and mulching materials are limited to synthetic plastics. The bio-based plastic materials are sustainable based on biodegradability, and resistant to photo-oxidation. The resistance to UV degradation is an essential property because solar radiation cleaves C-C bonds, which in turn impact the mechanical strength of the materials. In brief, the sustainability of plastics in farms is influenced by LCA data, mechanical and optical properties, and performance relative to other materials.

Urban agriculture (UA) seems a viable intervention to address urban food insecurity, however, experience has shown that urban gardens do not expand at the expected rate. Tackling this issue requires a deeper understanding of the main constraints that block UA expansion. Benin is not an exception; the country witnesses a breathtaking growth of its main cities that is in synchronization with a mounting food insecurity. Our research aims, therefore, to identify the main constraints for the expansion of UA in Benin, and adopt a three-pronged approach combined with a systematic literature review, a survey held among experienced urban gardeners, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. Altogether, the synthesis shows a predominance of five main constraints: lack of land and tenure insecurity, insufficient government support, restricted market access, limited access to productive factors, and inequality issues. Specifically, while the review showed that most barriers are linked and could be tackled together, the survey indicated a political unwillingness which in our in-depth interviews is explained by the unperceived benefits of investing in UA and the lack of enforcement of urban development plans. We suggest that Beninese authorities and academics move in synchronization where the former coordinates the planning of urban gardens and the latter provides evidence to trigger public and private investments in UA. The findings could be the basis for further research on UA in West Africa and the wider continent.

However, after years of significant growth in prices, a slowdown in pace and demand is expected. Rising interest rates, a strengthening of the crown and legislative changes in 2018 have influenced the price of farmland. Yet the prices of farmland in Czechia are a third of those in the countries of Western Europe, and so it still represents an interesting opportunity for investors. Currently, land is bought primarily by the farmers who work it. In Czechia, 80% of farmers farm on hired land, and rent increases are starting to be an issue for many of them. The return on the investment in agricultural land is currently around 50 years for an owner and 25 years for a farmer working the land. As research has shown, the price of farmland is an important factor in the sustainable development of agriculture in Czechia, along with the greening of production and the fight against soil erosion and the effects of climate change.

Three years of field experiments were carried out from 2015 to 2017 in the Lubelskie province (Poland) on rendzina soils. The experimental results indicate that the hulled wheats, even when cultivated with advanced technology, produced lower yields compared to the common and durum wheats (reduced by 30\u201356%). In spite of their lower yields, emmer and spelt retained appropriate technological parameters. Higher ash, protein, and wet gluten yields were characteristic of the hulled wheats; however, the high gluten spread of emmer (13.3 mm) may limit its application as a raw material in some food processes. In summary, hulled wheat species can be recommended for modern agricultural production as an alternative source of high-quality materials for the agricultural and food industries.

In Italy, about one-third of injuries involve the upper extremity, with long-term consequences for the workers and economic damage for agricultural companies and farms. This systematic review describes upper limb injuries among farmworkers, especially hand injuries, and highlights the main dangerous risk factors. Literature review included articles published in the major databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus), using a combination of some relevant keywords. This online search yielded 951 references; after selection, the authors analyzed 53 articles (3 narrative reviews and 50 original articles). From this analysis, it appears that younger male farmers are mostly involved, especially in the harvesting season. The upper limb and hand are often the body parts that sustain most damage as these are mostly involved in driving tractors or tools. The most frequent type of lesions are open wounds, lacerations, fractures, strains, and overexertion lesions. Sometimes, a distracting element (such as mobile phone use, quarrels, working hours load) is present; poor use of protective devices and lack of safety design in tools can also increase the risk of accidents. For these reasons, in the agricultural sector, a system of health promotion and good practices is needed to promote workers\u2019 awareness of the sources of risk, highlight more dangerous situations and apply organizational behavioral measures.

Field data was collected from more than 1000 farmers (involved in over 50 varieties of crops) in 22 riverine and coastal case study areas. Data was collected through site visits, surveys and five workshops conducted between November 2018 and June 2019. Based on the collected data sets, a new Agricultural Coastal Vulnerability Index (AGCVI) was developed and applied to the 22 sites located in two districts (Krishna and Guntur) of Coastal Andhra Pradesh. The analysis revealed that the areas with three crop seasons (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid) per year are highly vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, sites with one crop season (Kharif) per annum are the least vulnerable to climate change. Moreover, grains (particularly rice), flowers and fruit crops are more susceptible to climate change and its induced impacts. Rice is no longer a profitable crop in the case study areas partly as a result of unfavourable weather conditions, inadequate insurance provision and lack of government support for farmers. Cumulatively, all these circumstances impact farmers\u2019 incomes and socio-cultural practices: this is leading to a marriage crisis, with a reduction in the desirability of matrimony to farmers. These findings provide valuable information that can support climate and agriculture policies, as well as sustainable cropping patterns among farmers\u2019 communities in coastal areas of India in the future.

This treatment improves soil quality, increases crops yields, and sequestrates atmospheric carbon to the soil. Another widely studied aspect connecting biochar with agriculture is the composting processes of various agricultural waste with the addition of biochar. Obtaining the material via the pyrolysis of agricultural waste, including animal manure, has also been investigated. However, given the remarkable properties of biochar, its application potential could be utilized in other areas not yet thoroughly investigated.

Yet, little is known about the health impacts of WSD projects, especially on nutrition, vector breeding, water quality and the distribution of impacts. We conducted a qualitative study to deepen the understanding on perceived health impacts of completed WSD projects in four villages of Kolar district, India. Field data collection comprised: (i) focus group discussions with local women (n = 2); (ii) interviews (n = 40; purposive sampling) with farmers and labourers, project employees and health workers; and (iii) transect walks. Our main findings were impacts perceived on nutrition (e.g., food security through better crop survival, higher milk consumption from livestock, alongside increased pesticide exposure with expanded agriculture), potential for mosquito larval breeding (e.g., more breeding sites) and through opportunistic activities (e.g., reduced mental stress due to improved water access). Impacts perceived varied between participant categories (e.g., better nutrition in woman-headed households from livelihood support). Some of these findings, e.g., potential negative health implications, have previously not been reported. Our observations informed a health impact assessment of a planned WSD project, and may encourage implementing agencies to incorporate health considerations to enhance positive and mitigate negative health impacts in future WSD projects.

Using monthly climate and agriculture data, the influence of drought on maize and soybean yields\u2014two of the main crops in the region\u2014in northeast China since 1961 to 2017 were investigated. The results showed that the temperature in the growing season increased by 1.0 \u00b0C from the period 1998\u20132017 to the period 1961\u20131980, while the annual precipitation decreased slightly. However, precipitation trends varied throughout the growing season (May\u2013September), increasing slightly in May and June, but decreasing in July, August and September, associated with the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon. Consequently, the annual and growing season drought frequency increased by 15%, and 25%, respectively, in the period 1998\u20132017 relative to the period 1961\u20131980. The highest drought frequency (55%) was observed in September. At the same time, the drought intensity during the growing season increased by 7.8%. The increasing frequency and intensity of drought had negative influences on the two crops. During moderate drought years in the period 1961\u20132017, 3.2% and 10.4% of the provincial maize and soybean yields were lost, respectively. However, during more severe drought years, losses doubled for soybean (21.8%), but increased more than four-fold for maize (14.0%). Moreover, in comparison to the period 1961\u20131980, a higher proportion of the yields were lost in the period 1998\u20132017, particularly for maize, which increased by 15% (increase for soybean was 2.4%). This change largely depends on increasing droughts in August and September, when both crops are in their filling stages. The impact of drought on maize and soybean production was different during different growth stages, where a strong relationship was noted between drought and yield loss of soybean in its filling stage.

There are currently studies on integrons and antibiotic resistance genes; however, the presence and association of integrons in different agricultural crops and their subsequent dissemination and role in AMR have not been reported previously. This study examines the abundance of integrons, their gene cassette diversity in various crop soils, and their role in the dissemination of AMR in the southern region of China. Samples from different agri-crop soil, such as rice (R.S), sugarcane (S.S), citrus (C.S), banana (B.S), agricultural runoff (the point where the runoff of all sites meet (R.O)), and wild (non-agricultural) soil (W.S), were collected. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the abundance of integrons, and clone libraries were constructed to examine the gene cassette arrays. All the tested samples were found positive for Class-I (CL1) integrons and revealed a higher concentration and higher relative abundance of R.S than the others, with the least found at the W.S site. The W.S CL1 cassette arrays were found empty, and no putative conserved domains were found. The R.O was found to contain a high number of gene cassettes with various functions, while the smallest number of gene cassettes was found in the S.S among the crop soils. Most of the gene cassettes presented by the R.O were primarily shared with other sites, and the antibiotic-resistant genes were consistently observed to be dominant. The constructed clone libraries represented a diverse gene cassette array with 16% novel gene cassettes that play a vital role in pathogenesis, transportation, biosynthesis, and AMR. Most resistance-related gene cassettes were associated with the genes encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) and aminoglycosides. This study highlights the significant differences in the abundance of integrons among various agricultural soils and offers deep insight into the pools of gene cassettes that play a key role in the dissemination of integrons and AMR.

However, if more plant nutrients are deposited than the plant can absorb, the excess nitrogen seeps into the soil where it accumulates as nitrate. About 74% of the drinking water produced in Germany comes from groundwater. The legal limit of 50 milligrams of nitrate per liter of fresh water is exceeded frequently in Germany, especially in agricultural areas. High levels of nitrate in drinking water can quickly lead to health issues, under certain conditions. The nitrate problem is omnipresent in Germany. However, studies which determine the externalized costs of nitrogen eutrophication are mostly missing. The present study closes this gap by combining the results of a transdisciplinary investigation from hydrological analyses and environmental-economic calculations. Water samples were taken from a deep well in Hauneck, which is a municipality in Hesse (Germany). Afterwards, an isotope analysis was carried out to determine the groundwater residence time and possible sources of nitrate. Thus, in addition to the sources of pollution, concrete social costs were determined, using a damage cost approach as well as an avoidance cost approach. For Hauneck, it was found that about 54% of the drinking water price is directly linked to the externalization of costs. These are borne via the principle of the common burden. In addition, the isotope investigations have shown that the removal of excess nitrate will continue for decades, which will lead to long term external costs. The paper reveals how the internalization of these costs can contribute to the conservation of water resources.

In this paper, we study the potential of a laser speckle system as a low-cost solution for non-destructive phenotyping. The objective is to assess an original approach combining laser speckle with chemometrics to describe scattering and absorption properties of sunflower leaves, related to their chemical composition or internal structure. A laser diode system at two wavelengths 660 nm and 785 nm combined with polarization has been set up to differentiate four sunflower genotypes. REP-ASCA was used as a method to analyze parameters extracted from speckle patterns by reducing sources of measurement error. First findings have shown that measurement errors are mostly due to unwilling residual specular reflections. Moreover, results outlined that the genotype significantly impacts measurements. The variables involved in genotype dissociation are mainly related to scattering properties within the leaf. Moreover, an example of genotype classification using REP-ASCA outcomes is given and classify genotypes with an average error of about 20%. These encouraging results indicate that a laser speckle system is a promising tool to compare sunflower genotypes. Furthermore, an autonomous low-cost sensor based on this approach could be used directly in the field.

Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) plays an important role in the revegetation and rehabilitation of rainfed areas by modulating plant growth and metabolism and improving the fertility status of the rhizosphere soils. The current study explored the positive role of PGPR and salicylic acid (SA) on the health of the rhizosphere soil and plants grown under rainfed conditions. Maize seeds of two different varieties, i.e., SWL-2002 (drought tolerant) and CZP-2001 (drought sensitive), were soaked for 4 h prior to sowing in 24-h old culture of Planomicrobium chinense strain P1 (accession no. MF616408) and Bacillus cereus strain P2 (accession no. MF616406). The foliar spray of SA (150 mg/L) was applied on 28-days old seedlings. The combined treatment of the consortium of PGPR and SA not only alleviated the adverse effects of low moisture stress of soil in rainfed area but also resulted in significant accumulation of leaf chlorophyll content (40% and 24%), chlorophyll fluorescence (52% and 34%) and carotenoids (57% and 36%) in the shoot of both the varieties. The PGPR inoculation significantly reduced lipid peroxidation (33% and 23%) and decreased the proline content and antioxidant enzymes activities (32% and 38%) as compared to plants grown in rainfed soil. Significant increases (>52%) were noted in the contents of Ca, Mg, K Cu, Co, Fe and Zn in the shoots of plants and rhizosphere of maize inoculated with the PGPR consortium. The soil organic matter, total nitrogen and C/N ratio were increased (42%), concomitant with the decrease in the bulk density of the rhizosphere. The PGPR consortium, SA and their combined treatment significantly enhanced the IAA (73%) and GA (70%) contents but decreased (55%) the ABA content of shoot. The rhizosphere of plants treated with PGPR, SA and consortium showed a maximum accumulation (>50%) of IAA, GA and ABA contents, the sensitive variety had much higher ABA content than the tolerant variety. It is inferred from the results that rhizosphere soil of treated plants enriched with nutrients content, organic matter and greater concentration of growth promoting phytohormones, as well as stress hormone ABA, which has better potential for seed germination and establishment of seedlings for succeeding crops.

This scenario highlights the urgent need for agricultural modernization as a crucial step to face forthcoming difficulties. Precision agriculture techniques appear as a feasible option to help solve these problems. However, their use needs to be reinvented and tested according to different parameters, in order to define both the environmental and the economic impact of these new technologies not only on agricultural production, but also on agricultural sustainability. This paper intends, therefore, to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of precision agriculture through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)/remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) techniques in small Mediterranean farms. We present specific data obtained through the application of the aforementioned techniques in three farms located along the Portuguese-Spanish border, considering three parameters (seeding failure, differentiated irrigation and differentiated fertilization) in order to determine not only the ecological benefits of these methods, but also their economic and productivity aspects. The obtained results, based on these methods, highlight the fact that an efficient combination of UAV/RPAS and NDVI techniques allows for important economic savings in productivity factors, thus promoting a sustainable agriculture both in ecological and economic terms. Additionally, contrary to what is generally defended, even in small farms, as the ones assessed in this study (less than 50 ha), the costs associated with the application of the aforementioned precision agriculture processes are largely surpassed by the economic gains achieved with their application, regardless of the notorious environmental benefits introduced by the reduction of crucial production inputs as water and fertilizers.

By striving for sustainable economic development and growth, as well as preservation of the ecosystem, organic agricultural production aims to produce high-quality food. Within the socio-economic space, the role of the state as a regulator of production and market relations is indispensable. The state often uses fiscal policy as an instrument for the regulation of relations in the sphere of production and trade. The level of the tax burden is of vital importance for achieving a sustainable level of agricultural development. From the aspect of the Serbian economy, the taxation of agriculture in the future period must be based on a system of tax incentives for organic production. In the long run, this can increase the volume of organic production and the use of healthy food in human nutrition.

These WSNs allow real time monitoring, enabling intelligent decision-making to maximize yields and minimize cost. Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications. A system is designed and implemented to address specific design requirements that are brought about by the considered environment. A simple synchronization scheme is described to provide time-correlated measurements using the sink node\u2019s clock as reference. The proposed system was installed on an olive grove to assess its effectiveness in providing a low-cost system, capable of acquiring synchronized measurements. The obtained results indicate the system\u2019s overall effectiveness, revealing a small but expected difference in the acquired measurements\u2019 time correlation, caused mostly by serial transmission delays, while yielding a plethora of relevant environmental conditions.

The main function of SPIs as protease enzymes is to regulate the proteolytic activity. In plants, most of the studies of SPIs have been focused on their physiological role. The initial studies carried out in plants showed that SPIs participate in the regulation of endogenous proteolytic processes, as the regulation of proteases in seeds. Besides, it was observed that SPIs also participate in the regulation of cell death during plant development and senescence. On the other hand, plant SPIs have an important role in plant defense against pests and phytopathogenic microorganisms. In the last 20 years, several transgenic plants over-expressing SPIs have been produced and tested in order to achieve the increase of the resistance against pathogenic insects. Finally, in molecular farming, SPIs have been employed to minimize the proteolysis of recombinant proteins expressed in plants. The present review discusses the potential biotechnological applications of plant SPIs in the agriculture field.

Currently, almost the entire territory of the country is subject to varying degrees of degradation. The intensity of the desertification processes in different natural zones is influenced by both natural climatic and anthropogenic factors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of desertification on environmental and socio-economic living conditions, as well as on living standards of the local population. In this work, for the first time, the socio-economic aspects of desertification have been studied on a common methodological basis in different Mongolian aimags over a ten-year period. In order to carry out in-depth research, we used the submeridional and sublatitudinal principles for selecting the model study areas, as well as specific criteria and expert assessment. We used a sociological survey as the main method, based on a designed questionnaire, which was translated into Mongolian. The questionnaire includes questions regarding the influence of desertification on traditional nomadic farming, health of family members, water supply of households, water quality, living standards, etc. The results of the sociological surveys made it possible to draw conclusions on the impact of desertification on households, to identify the main problems of local people, and to describe the dynamics of the socio-economic status of the population living in the model areas. Our studies have demonstrated the intensification of the impact of desertification processes in different natural zones, administrative-territorial units and settlement systems in Mongolia.

The adaptation of farming to the effects of global climate change may lead to the maximization of agricultural production, which is an important and desirable improvement. The main aim of this paper is to rank and quantify the impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector of Cyprus, through a multi-round Delphi survey seeking a consensus agreement in a group of experts. A multidisciplinary group of 20 experts stated their willingness-to-pay for various impacts of climate change. By applying this method, the individual impacts of climate change on crop production and water resources were brought into the modeling effort on equal footing with cost values. The final cost impact estimate represents the total estimated cost of climate change in the agricultural sector. According to the results, this cost reaches EUR 25.08 million annually for the agricultural sector, and EUR 366.48 million for the whole country. Therefore, it is expected that in the seven-year programming period 2014\u20132020 the total cost of climate change on agriculture ranges from EUR 176 to EUR 2565 million. The most significant impacts are due to the increasing level of CO2 in the atmosphere and the burden of biodiversity and ecosystems.

In the research literature, how best to integrate and align effective measures for tackling diffuse pollution, within the context of the EU\u2019s multilevel governance structure, remains an open question. This paper focuses on the first and second implementation cycles of the WFD to explore how national governance arrangements either facilitated or hindered the adoption of effective policies, especially with regards to the delivery of agricultural and water policies on the ground. It draws on data collected through systematic document analysis and interviews with key experts, policymakers and interest groups, and presents a comparative analysis of two case studies: England and Scotland. The case studies show that Scotland\u2019s joined-up governance structure, which enabled policymakers and interest groups to work together and to build trust and cooperation, facilitated the adoption of stricter measures for tackling diffuse pollution. In contrast, in England institutional fragmentation prevented a meaningful engagement of all parties and acted as a barrier. The analysis unpacks the design of policy mixes and the conditions that allow national governments to pursue more holistic and integrated governance approaches to overcome opposition from interest groups and gain their support.

This study investigated the variation of different Fusarium metabolites (including the related regulated, masked, and emerging mycotoxin) in maize from various agriculture regions of South Africa. The relationship between the maize producing regions, the maize type, as well as the mycotoxins was established. A total of 123 maize samples was analyzed by a LC-MS/MS multi-mycotoxin method. The results revealed that all maize types exhibited a mixture of free, masked, and emerging mycotoxins contamination across the regions with an average of 5 and up to 24 out of 42 investigated Fusarium mycotoxins, including 1 to 3 masked forms at the same time. Data obtained show that fumonisin B1, B2, B3, B4, and A1 were the most prevalent mycotoxins and had maximum contamination levels of 8908, 3383, 990, 1014, and 51.5 \u00b5g/kg, respectively. Deoxynivalenol occurred in 50% of the samples with a mean concentration of 152 \u00b5g/kg (max 1380 \u00b5g/kg). Thirty-three percent of the samples were contaminated with zearalenone at a mean concentration of 13.6 \u00b5g/kg (max 146 \u00b5g/kg). Of the masked mycotoxins, DON-3-glucoside occurred at a high incidence level of 53%. Among emerging toxins, moniliformin, fusarinolic acid, and beauvericin showed high occurrences at 98%, 98%, and 83%, and had maximum contamination levels of 1130, 3422, and 142 \u00b5g/kg, respectively.

CSA is an important approach to promote local economic growth and contribute to sustainable agriculture. Although CSA is widely accepted across the United States, the total number of CSA membership is still very low. It is important to determine the factors that affect the future development of CSA because of its social and environmental benefits. In this study, we analyze how the motivation, barriers, and methods of advertisement influence the participation dynamics of CSA by segmenting consumers based on their past, current, and future CSA participation. Based on a national survey with 795 responses, the results show that the younger generation, high-income families, and people who support sustainable agriculture are more likely to renew their CSA subscription. CSA members are found to be very sensitive to the time of food distribution, the price of products, and the location of CSA farms. Moreover, the impacts of perceived barriers of CSA participation and advertisement method vary based on respondents\u2019 membership status. This paper sheds light on factors that influence various consumer groups and offers a more dynamic analysis of CSA consumer behavior. This analysis enhances understanding of CSA members\u2019 preferences and could help CSA programs expand in the future and to better promote local food systems and sustainable agriculture.

This paper aims to (1) identify the \u201ctriggers\u201d for novelty production in UA; (2) characterize the different kinds of novelties applied in UA; (3) evaluate the \u201cinnovativeness\u201d of those social, environmental and economic novelties; and, (4) estimate the links between novelties and sustainability. The study was based on the evaluation of 11 case studies in four Western European countries (Italy, Germany, France and Spain). The results show that the trigger and origin of new activities can often be traced back to specific problems that initiators were intended to address or solve. In total, we found 147 novelties produced in the 11 case studies. More novelties are produced in the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability than in the economic. In most cases, external stakeholders played an important role in supporting the projects. The analysis further suggests that innovativeness enhances the overall sustainability in urban agriculture projects.

This study aimed to analyse the influence of these factors and their interactions to determine the emissions by evaluating the environmental cost expressed as the kg of CO2 emitted per kg of production in each of the crops and seasons studied. For this purpose, a field trial was conducted on a farm in Seville (Spain). The study compared Conservation Agriculture, including its three principles (no-tillage, permanent soil cover, and crop rotations), with conventional tillage. Carbon dioxide emissions measured across the four seasons of the experiment showed an increase strongly influenced by rainfall during the vegetative period, in both soil management systems. The results of this study confirm that extreme events of precipitation away from the normal means, result in episodes of high CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. This is very important because one of the consequences for future scenarios of climate change is precisely the increase of extreme episodes of precipitation and periods extremely dry, depending on the area considered. The total of emission values of the different plots of the study show how the soils under the conventional system (tillage) have been emitting 67% more than soils under the conventional agriculture system during the 2010/11 campaign and 25% for the last campaign where the most appreciable differences are observed.

Recently, there have been many artificial neural network (ANN) methods used in agricultural classification tasks, which are task specific and require big datasets. These two characteristics are quite different from how humans learn intelligently. Undoubtedly, it would be exciting if the models can accumulate knowledge to handle continual tasks. Towards this goal, we propose an ANN-based continual classification method via memory storage and retrieval, with two clear advantages: Few data and high flexibility. This proposed ANN-based model combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN). Through learning of the similarity between input paired data, the CNN part only requires few raw data to achieve a good performance, suitable for a classification task. The GAN part is used to extract important information from old tasks and generate abstracted images as memory for the future task. Experimental results show that the regular CNN model performs poorly on the continual tasks (pest and plant classification), due to the forgetting problem. However, our proposed method can distinguish all the categories from new and old tasks with good performance, owing to its ability of accumulating knowledge and alleviating forgetting. There are so many possible applications of this proposed approach in the agricultural field, for instance, the intelligent fruit picking robots, which can recognize and pick different kinds of fruits; the plant protection is achieved by automatic identification of diseases and pests, which can continuously improve the detection range. Thus, this work also provides a reference for other studies towards more intelligent and flexible applications in agriculture.

The manual measurement, which is a common practice is an error-prone and time-consuming process. The irregular fields make it even more difficult to calculate the work area. An automatic solution that uses smart technology and algorithms to precisely calculate the work area is crucial for the advancement of agriculture. In this work, we have developed a smart system that utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that records the movement of agriculture machinery and use it to measure the precise work area of its usage. The system couples the nearest neighbourhood algorithms with Contact-based mechanisms to find the precise work area for different shaped fields and activities. The system was able to record the movement of machinery and calculate its work area, regardless of how many times the machinery runs through a particular field. Our evaluation shows that the system was able to precisely find the work boundaries and calculate the area with a maximum of 9% error for irregular shapes.

Although the sector is one of the most advanced and intense agricultural production systems worldwide, it faces challenges, such as climate change and environmental and social unsustainability of industrial production. To overcome these challenges, alternative food production initiatives have emerged, especially in large cities such as Amsterdam. Some initiatives involve producing food in the urban environment, supported by new technologies and practices, so-called high-tech urban agriculture (HTUA). These initiatives make cultivation of plants inside and on top of buildings possible and increase green spaces in urban areas. The emerging agricultural technologies are creating new business environments that are shape d by technology developers (e.g., suppliers of horticultural light emitting diodes (LED) and control environment systems) and developers of alternative food production practices (e.g., HTUA start-ups). However, research shows that the uptake of these technological innovations in urban planning processes is problematic. Therefore, this research analyzes the barriers that local government planners and HTUA developers are facing in the embedding of HTUA in urban planning processes, using the city of Amsterdam as a case study. This study draws on actor-network theory (ANT) to analyze the interactions between planners, technologies, technology developers and developers of alternative food production practices. Several concepts of ANT are integrated into a multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions (MLP) to create a new theoretical framework that can explain how interactions between technologies and planning actors transform the incumbent social\u2013technical regime. The configuration of interactions between social and material entities in technology development and adoption processes in Amsterdam is analyzed through the lens of this theoretical framework. The data in this study were gathered by tracing actors and their connections by using ethnographic research methods. In the course of the integration of new technologies into urban planning practices, gaps between technologies, technology developers, and planning actors have been identified. The results of this study show a lacking connection between planning actors and technology developers, although planning actors do interact with developers of alternative food production practices. These interactions are influenced by agency of artefacts such as visualizations of the future projects. The paper concludes that for the utilization of emerging technologies for sustainability transition of cities, the existing gap between technology developers and planning actors needs to be bridged through the integration of technology development visions in urban agendas and planning processes.

The surface temperature of plants changes rapidly under stress conditions, which makes thermal RS a useful tool for real-time detection of plant stress conditions. Current applications of UAV thermal RS include monitoring plant water stress, detecting plant diseases, assessing crop yield estimation, and plant phenotyping. However, the correct use and interpretation of thermal data are based on basic knowledge of the nature of thermal radiation. Therefore, aspects that are related to calibration and ground data collection, in which the use of reference panels is highly recommended, as well as data processing, must be carefully considered.

To overcome the obstacles and to improve implementation, different solutions and actions are required. This study aims to illustrate ways of minimizing or removing obstacles and how to overcome the implementation gap. Unfortunately, the diversity of obstacles and their complexity mean there are no quick and easy solutions. A broader approach that addresses different dimensions and stakeholders is required.

To achieve this objective, a reliable and updated description of the local status of crops is required. Remote sensing, and in particular satellite-based imagery, proved to be a valuable tool in crop mapping, monitoring, and diseases assessment. However, freely available satellite imagery with low or moderate resolutions showed some limits in specific agricultural applications, e.g., where crops are grown by rows. Indeed, in this framework, the satellite\u2019s output could be biased by intra-row covering, giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper presents a novel satellite imagery refinement framework, based on a deep learning technique which exploits information properly derived from high resolution images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multispectral sensors. To train the convolutional neural network, only a single UAV-driven dataset is required, making the proposed approach simple and cost-effective. A vineyard in Serralunga d\u2019Alba (Northern Italy) was chosen as a case study for validation purposes. Refined satellite-driven normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, acquired in four different periods during the vine growing season, were shown to better describe crop status with respect to raw datasets by correlation analysis and ANOVA. In addition, using a K-means based classifier, 3-class vineyard vigor maps were profitably derived from the NDVI maps, which are a valuable tool for growers.

In the area of agriculture production, IoT-based WSN has been used to observe the yields condition and automate agriculture precision using various sensors. These sensors are deployed in the agricultural environment to improve production yields through intelligent farming decisions and obtain information regarding crops, plants, temperature measurement, humidity, and irrigation systems. However, sensors have limited resources concerning processing, energy, transmitting, and memory capabilities that can negatively impact agriculture production. Besides efficiency, the protection and security of these IoT-based agricultural sensors are also important from malicious adversaries. In this article, we proposed an IoT-based WSN framework as an application to smart agriculture comprising different design levels. Firstly, agricultural sensors capture relevant data and determine a set of cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision function. Additionally, the strength of the signals on the transmission links is measured while using signal to noise ratio (SNR) to achieve consistent and efficient data transmissions. Secondly, security is provided for data transmission from agricultural sensors towards base stations (BS) while using the recurrence of the linear congruential generator. The simulated results proved that the proposed framework significantly enhanced the communication performance as an average of 13.5% in the network throughput, 38.5% in the packets drop ratio, 13.5% in the network latency, 16% in the energy consumption, and 26% in the routing overheads for smart agriculture, as compared to other solutions.

However, no tangible and systematic evidence exists on how this agriculture would participate in alleviating impacts on vulnerable rural communities. This paper provides a narrative systematic review (SR) integrated with a bibliometric analysis and a concept network analysis to determine how, in this changing climate, sustainable agriculture can increase the resilience of agrosystems. Our search ranged from the date of the first relevant article until the end of 2018. The results generated demonstrated the following: (a) Only single practices and methods have been studied to assess the impacts on single ecosystem services; (b) Soil quality and health are considered a key indicator of sustainable agriculture; (c) Although the assessed practices and methods were shown to improve the biodiversity of agrosystems, which makes them more resilient to extreme climate events, we are still far from developing interdisciplinary and multidimensional agriculture that integrates all management aspects and generates a full range of ecosystem services. In conclusion, this study addressed the following recommendations for the scientific community and policymakers to orient future research strategies and efforts: (a) The integration of all agrosystem services into sustainable management using an ecosystem-based approach on a life-cycle basis using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method; (b) Improving the scientific understanding of traditional knowledge to facilitate greater synergy and further integration; (c) The unification of assessment methods and indicators for the quantification of impacts; (d) The creation of a platform to share, monitor, screen, and approve assessments and evaluations of sustainable agriculture by region.

As a result of the occurring changes in agriculture itself and in its environment, the importance of small agricultural holdings is permanently declining. The gradual disappearance of small family farms not only disrupts the direct relationships between food producers and consumers, but also puts food security at risk, primarily on a local and regional scale. The purpose of the article is an attempt to present that the development of Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) can offer an alternative to the occurring current distribution channels.

The electronics of the device is also discussed, since Agri.q should be ready to send-receive data to move autonomously or to be remotely controlled by means of dedicated processing units and transmitter-receiver modules. This paper collects all these elements and shows the advances of the previous works, describing the design process of the mechatronic system and showing the realization phase, whose outcome is the physical prototype.

This research presents a comprehensive study on the determination of P supplying capacity in this region of Vietnam to examine the possibility of reducing P fertilizer input. In total, 120 soil samples were collected to evaluate total P and Bray 1 available P in the soils. Phosphorus maximum sorption, degree of P saturation, P release, and the effect of P fertilizer on corn (Zea mays L.) yield in greenhouses and fields were also determined. Total P concentrations in 57% of the soil samples evaluated yielded high P concentrations (>560 mg P/kg), while 74% of the samples had high Bray 1 available P concentrations (>20 mg P/kg soil). Maximum P sorption ranged from 149 to 555 mg P/kg soil, respectively, and had negative correlation with available P (r = \u22120.63*). The percentages of P saturation ranged from 0.63% to 5.5% and correlated with available P (r = 0.98**). Maximum P release ranged from 1.2 to 62 mg P/kg soil, respectively, and correlated with available P (r = 0.96**). Corn grown in soils with available P concentrations >15 mg P/kg did not respond to P fertilizer in greenhouse or field experiments. We conclude that many farmers in this region can reduce P fertilizer input, thus increasing their profits and reducing negative environmental impacts associated with excess soil P for sustainable agriculture.

Furthermore, System of Systems (SoS) expands the use of local clouds for the evolution of integration and communication technologies. SoS devices need to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities including service-oriented management and different QoS characteristics monitoring. Smart applications depend on information quality since they are driven by processes which require communication robustness and enough bandwidth. Interconnectivity and interoperability facilities among different smart devices can be achieved using Arrowhead Framework technology via its core systems and services. Arrowhead Framework is targeting smart IoT devices with wide applicability areas including smart building, smart energy, smart cities, smart agriculture, etc. The advantages of Arrowhead Framework can be underlined by parameters such as transmission speed, latency, security, etc. This paper presents a survey of Arrowhead Framework in IoT/SoS dedicated architectures for smart cities and smart agriculture developed around smart cities, aiming to outline its significant impact on the global performances. The advantages of Arrowhead Framework technology are emphasized by analysis of several smart cities use-cases and a novel architecture for a telemetry system that will enable the use of Arrowhead technology in smart agriculture area is introduced and detailed by authors.

Anchored by a partnership with the Fundaci\u00f3n para la Investigaci\u00f3n Participativa con Agricultores de Honduras (FIPAH) and the Yorito Municipal Health Centre, a cross-sectional household survey was administered in Yorito, Honduras, in July 2014. The study population included 1263 individuals from 248 households across 22 rural communities. A multivariate mixed effects negative binomial regression model was built to investigate the relationship between the self-reported number of months without food availability and access from subsistence agriculture in the previous year (August 2013\u2013July 2014) and demographic, socioeconomic, and agricultural production variables. This study found a lengthier \u2018lean season\u2019 among surveyed household than previously documented in Honduras. Overall, 62.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): [59.52, 64.87]) of individuals experienced at least four months of insufficient food in the previous year. Individuals from poorer and larger households were more likely to experience insufficient food compared to individuals from wealthier and smaller households. Additionally, individuals from households that produced both maize and beans were less likely to have insufficient food compared to individuals from households that did not grow these staple crops (prevalence ratio (PR) = 0.83; 95% CI: [0.69, 0.99]). Receiving remittances from a migrant family member did not significantly reduce the prevalence of having insufficient food. As unpredictable crop yields linked to climate change and extreme weather events are projected to negatively influence the food security and nutrition outcomes of rural populations, it is important to understand how demographic, socioeconomic, and agricultural production factors may modify the ability of individuals and households engaged in small-scale subsistence agriculture to respond to adverse shocks.

This paper examines the regional differences, spatial\u2013temporal pattern and dynamic evolution of the carbon emission intensity of agriculture production from 1991 to 2018 through the Theil index and spatial data analysis. The results are shown as follows: The overall differences in carbon emission intensity of agriculture production presents a slightly enlarging trend, while the inter-regional differences in carbon emissions intensity is decreasing, but the intra-regional difference of carbon emissions intensity presented an expanding trend. The difference in carbon emission intensity between the eastern and central regions is not obvious, and the difference in carbon emission intensity in the western region shows a fluctuating and increasing trend. The overall differences caused by intra-regional differences; the average annual contribution of intra-regional differences is 67.84%, of which the average annual contribution of western region differences is 64.24%. The carbon emission intensity of agricultural production in China shows a downward trend, with provinces with high carbon emission intensity remaining stable, while provinces with low intensity are expanding. The Global Moran\u2019s I index indicates that China\u2019s carbon emission intensity of agricultural production shows a clear trend of spatial aggregation. The agglomeration trend of high agricultural carbon emission remains stable, and the overall pattern of agricultural carbon emission intensity shows a pattern of increasing differentiation from east to west.

In the current study, an attempt was made to map the agriculture sprawl from 1987 to 2017 using temporal Landsat images in a geographic information system (GIS) environment for better decision-making and sustainable agriculture expansion. Our findings indicated that the agriculture activities developed through two crucial stages: high and low rise stages. Low rise stages occurred during three sub-stages from April 1987 to April 1988, from September 1993 to August 1998, and from April 2008 to May 2015, with overall change rates of 37.9, 44.4, and 30.5 km2/year, respectively. High rise stages occurred during three sub-stages from April 1988 to February 1993, from September 2000 to March 2006, and from April 2016 to August 2017, with overall change rates of 132.4, 159.1, and 119.5 km2/year, respectively. Different environmental problems due to uncontrolled agriculture activities were observed in the area, including substantial depletion of the groundwater table. Another environmental impact observed was the appearance of sinkholes that occurred suddenly with no warning signs. These environmental impacts will increase in the future if no regulated restrictions are implemented by decision-makers.

Consequently, VIs originally developed for traditional airborne and spaceborne sensors have become applicable to UAV systems. In this study, we investigated the difference in tillage treatments for cotton and sorghum using various RGB and NIR VIs. Minimized tillage has been known to increase farm sustainability and potentially optimize productivity over time; however, repeated tillage is the most commonly-adopted management practice in agriculture. To this day, quantitative comparisons of plant growth patterns between conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) fields are often inconsistent. In this study, high-resolution and multi-temporal UAV data were used for the analysis of tillage effects on plant health and the performance of various vegetation indices investigated. Time series data over ten dates were acquired on a weekly basis by RGB and multispectral (MS) UAV platforms: a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and a DJI Matrice 100 with the SlantRange 3p sensor. Ground reflectance panels and an ambient illumination sensor were used for the radiometric calibration of RGB and MS orthomosaic images, respectively. Various RGB and NIR-based vegetation indices were then calculated for the comparison between CT and NT treatments. In addition, a one-tailed Z-test was conducted to check the significance of VIs\u2019 difference between CT and NT treatments. The results showed distinct differences in VIs between tillage treatments during the whole growing season. NIR-based VIs showed better discrimination performance than RGB-based VIs. Out of 13 VIs, the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) showed better performance in terms of quantitative difference measurements and the Z-test between tillage treatments. The modified green red vegetation index (MGRVI) and excess green (ExG) showed reliable separability and can be an alternative for economic RGB UAV application.

Based on a comprehensive analysis of a large number of documents at home and abroad, this paper reviews the research on community-supported agriculture from the perspective of its origin, development process, characteristics, modes, functions and problems, aiming at summarizing the experiences and current problems and demonstrating recent research and development status of CSA in China in hope of providing references for its practice and research. The key conclusions in this review are: (1) CSA has a short history in China, but it is developing rapidly; (2) Chain\u2019s CSA is characterized by a cooperative network with food safety as the primary development goal, agricultural product distribution as the main operation mode, and trust as the basis; (3) China\u2019s CSA lacks of government\u2019s support, and develops roughly at a small-scale. (4) With unique modes and functions, China\u2019s CSA is facing some problems such as management, funding, talents, markets, technology and consumers\u2019 trust. The development of CSA in China needs joint efforts from government, producers and consumers. China\u2019s CSA needs to rely on its own advantages, make full use of its economic, social, ecological and cultural functions, combine Internet and ecological agricultural technology and explore the local modes with Chinese characteristics.

Such a context implies innovative issues in agricultural water management and practices, at both the field and the system or the basin scales, mainly in irrigation to cope with water scarcity, environmental friendliness, and rural society welfare. Therefore, this special issue was set to present and discuss recent achievements in water, agriculture, and food nexus at different scales, thus to promote sustainable development of irrigated agriculture and to develop integrated approaches to water and food. Papers cover various domains including: (a) evapotranspiration and crop water use; (b) improving water management in irrigated agriculture, particularly irrigation scheduling; (c) adaptation of agricultural systems to enhance water use and water productivity to face water scarcity and climate change; (d) improving irrigation systems design and management adopting multi-criteria and risk approaches; (e) ensuring sustainable management for anthropic ecosystems favoring safe and high-quality food production, as well as the conservation of natural ecosystems; (f) assessing the impact of water scarcity and, mainly, droughts; (g) conservation of water quality resources, namely by preventing contamination with nitrates; (h) use of modern mapping technologies and remote sensing information; and (i) fostering a participative and inclusive governance of water for food security and population welfare.

Rapid and continuous monitoring of environmental and crop parameters may be used to develop mathematical models to predict crop response to microclimatic changes. Here, we applied the energy cascade model (MEC) on green- and red-leaf butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata). We tooled up the model to describe the changing leaf functional efficiency during the growing period. We validated the model on an independent dataset with two different vapor pressure deficit (VPD) levels, corresponding to nominal (low VPD) and off-nominal (high VPD) conditions. Under low VPD, the modified model accurately predicted the transpiration rate (RMSE = 0.10 Lm\u22122), edible biomass (RMSE = 6.87 g m\u22122), net-photosynthesis (rBIAS = 34%), and stomatal conductance (rBIAS = 39%). Under high VPD, the model overestimated photosynthesis and stomatal conductance (rBIAS = 76\u201368%). This inconsistency is likely due to the empirical nature of the original model, which was designed for nominal conditions. Here, applications of the modified model are discussed, and possible improvements are suggested based on plant morpho-physiological changes occurring in sub-optimal scenarios.

This study was carried out in the Tabuleiro de Russas irrigated perimeter, in northeast Brazil, over the drought period of 2012\u20132018. Two analyses were conducted: (i) drought characterization, using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based on drought duration and frequency criteria; and (ii) analysis of farmers\u2019 perceptions of drought via selection of explanatory variables using the Random Forest (RF) and the Decision Tree (DT) methods. The 2012\u20132018 drought period was defined as a meteorological phenomenon by local farmers; however, an SPI evaluation indicated that the drought was of a hydrological nature. According to the RF analysis, four of the nine study variables were more statistically important than the others in influencing farmers\u2019 perception of drought: number of cultivated land plots, farmer\u2019s age, years of experience in the agriculture sector, and education level. These results were confirmed using DT analysis. Understanding the relationship between these variables and farmers\u2019 perception of drought could aid in the development of an adaptation strategy to water deficit scenarios. Farmers\u2019 perception can be beneficial in reducing conflicts, adopting proactive management practices, and developing a holistic and efficient early warning drought system.

Moreover, many review papers are available in the literature. The present work describes a literature review that adopts the form of a systematic mapping study, following a formal methodology. Eight mapping questions were defined, analyzing the main types of research, techniques, platforms, topics, and spectral information. A predefined search string was applied in the Scopus database, obtaining 1590 candidate papers. Afterwards, the most relevant 106 papers were selected, considering those with more than six citations per year. These are analyzed in more detail, answering the mapping questions for each paper. In this way, the current trends and new opportunities are discovered. As a result, increasing interest in the area has been observed since 2000; the most frequently addressed problems are those related to parameter estimation, growth vigor, and water usage, using classification techniques, that are mostly applied on RGB and hyperspectral images, captured from drones and satellites. A general recommendation that emerges from this study is to build on existing resources, such as agricultural image datasets, public satellite imagery, and deep learning toolkits.

Based on the review, biobased plastic nets made from polyamino acids, polysaccharide derivatives (DS), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polycaprolactone (PCL), polyhydroxylalkanoate (PHA), and polylactic acid (PLA) are shown to be highly biodegradable compared to conventional plastics such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride. The biodegradability of these materials is due to the use of natural precursors. However, nonbiodegradable plastics are the materials of choice in agricultural applications for the following reasons. Global commercial production of biobased plastics is low (~1%) due to the absence of facile and scalable production methods. Even though biobased materials are ecologically benign, they are limited in agricultural settings, given the low tensile strength and disruption of the activities of natural insect predators such as spiders. The enhancement of the material properties of biobased plastics involves a trade-off with sustainability. Chemical additives such as heavy metals and volatile compounds enhance the mechanical properties of biobased plastics but limit their sustainability. The current constraints on the production of biobased plastic nets can be resolved through electrospinning techniques that facilitate the development of plastic nets with controllable composition, porosity, and surface areas.

The aim of this research was to assess the effects of native hayseed mixtures on plant and microarthropod communities in an agricultural area of Northern Italy. Three different experimental treatments were set up. The first was a control (C) (i.e., non-seeded plots left to spontaneous vegetation succession after ploughing no deeper than 15 cm). The second, hayseed seeded (Hs) after ploughing no deeper than 15 cm. The third experimental treatment was hayseed overseeded (Ov) on the resident plant community after only a superficial harrowing. Ov plots exhibited the preeminent positive effects on the total productivity and quality of the grassland in terms of total vegetation cover, cover and richness of typical grassland species (i.e., Molinio-Arrhenatheretea species), and cover of legumes, grasses and perennial species. Moreover, Ov sites exhibited the highest abundance of microarthropod taxa and soil biological quality (QBS-ar) but only in spring, when the disturbance of ploughing negatively affected Hs and C plots. On the other hand, Hs sites showed a great reduction of invasive alien (i.e., Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Artemisia verlotiorum) and segetal weed species (i.e., Capsella bursa-pastoris and Spergula arvensis) in terms of cover. This study provides valuable indication on using hayseed mixtures to create grassland habitats as reservoir of native flora and soil biodiversity in agriculture areas.

Access to electricity in the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa is only 28%, roughly 600 million people. The financing of rural electrification is challenging and, in order to accomplish higher private sector investments, new innovative business models have to be developed. In this paper, a new approach in the financing of microgrid electrification activities is proposed and investigated. In this approach, agriculture related businesses take the lead in the electrification activities of the surrounding communities. It is shown that the high cost of rural electrification can be met through the increased value of locally produced products, and cross-subsidization can take place in order to decrease the cost of household electrification. The approach is implemented in a case study in Rwanda, through which the possibility of local agricultural cooperatives leading electrification activities is demonstrated.

This aspect is even more evident in industrial agriculture, which is based on the use of multiple chemical products derived from non-natural synthesis. In more developed countries, a new idea of ecology linked to agricultural production has been increasingly developed and, for this reason, there has been a greater diffusion of differentiated agricultural models taking into consideration the environmental impact of production choices and policies addressed to the conservation of natural resources. In urban agricultural production, it is even more important to adopt resilient production models that, in addition to developing responsible production paths and allowing a positive connection with the needs of consumers, guarantees reasonable and positive behaviors respecting the environment in which most of the urban population lives; in other words, the implementation of goal 12 of the sustainable development goals (SDG #12 Responsible Production and Consumption) of the United Nations. In this work, we report some case studies inspired by the activities carried out by the Slow Food Association in Africa and demonstrate the importance of agroecological models in small-scale agricultural systems, related to the development of school and community gardens in small urban areas of different African countries, as a tool for integrating agricultural activities aimed at social resilience and the conservation of ecosystems.

It helps to effectively use the agricultural resources and management tools and monitors different parameters to attain better quality yield and production. WSN makes use of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), a wireless technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. LoRaWAN is one of the most successful LPWAN technologies despite its low data rate and because of its low deployment and management costs. Greenhouses are susceptible to different types of interference and diversification, demanding an improved WSN design scheme. In this paper, we contemplate the viable challenges for PA in greenhouses and propose the successive steps essential for effectual WSN deployment and facilitation. We performed a real-time, end-to-end deployment of a LoRaWAN-based sensor network in a greenhouse of the \u2019Proefcentrum Hoogstraten\u2019 research center in Belgium. We have designed a dashboard for better visualization and analysis of the data, analyzed the power consumption for the LoRaWAN communication, and tried three different enclosure types (commercial, simple box and airflow box, respectively). We validated the implications of real-word challenges on the end-to-end deployment and air circulation for the correct sensor readings. We found that temperature and humidity have a larger impact on the sensor readings inside the greenhouse than we initially thought, which we successfully solved through the airflow box design.

Irrigation water use, soil moisture, and agronomic data were monitored, and laboratory testing was conducted for soil samples, which were collected from 0 to 40 cm depth before planting and after harvest during the study period of 2015\u20132017. Calculation of crop coefficient (Kc) revealed a significant decrease in Kc values under CA as compared to CT. The result depicted that CA with a drip irrigation system significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) reduced Kc values of crops as compared to CT. Specifically, 20% reductions were observed for onion, cabbage, and garlic under CA whereas 10% reductions were observed for pepper throughout the crop base period. Consequently, irrigation water measurement showed that about 18% to 28% of a significant irrigation water savings were observed for the range of vegetables under CA as compared to CT. On the other hand, the results of soil measurement showed the CA practice significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) increased soil moisture (4%, 7%, 8%, and 10% increment for onion, cabbage, garlic, pepper) than CT practice even if irrigation input was small in CA practice. In addition, CA was found to improve the soil physico-chemical properties with significant improvement on organic matter (10%), field capacity (4%), and total nitrogen (10%) in the Dangishta experimental site. CA with drip irrigation is evidenced to be an efficient water-saving technology while improving soil properties to support sustainable intensification in the region.

Several methods were used to compile the national inventory, in particular the questionnaire survey method. The Czech part of the research was based on 30 questionnaires conducted among both farmers and agricultural organizations engaged in demonstration activities. The questions were focused on a specialization in agriculture, type of the management, connections with networks and their size, types of demonstration activities according to the types of farms and non-productive activities. The most common topics and purposes for demonstration in the Czech Republic are recorded for the category arable land with combined crops. Highly linked to sustainability are activities such as conservation agriculture on arable land with combined crops, root crops and fodders mainly due to a reduction of soil erosion within crop production and animal health management and welfare for dairy within livestock production. The Ministry of Agriculture has prepared a subsidy program to help farmers in the form of illustrative practical demonstrations of comprehensive sustainable farming practices. The main added values for the end-users, if the generated knowledge is implemented, are to strengthen the knowledge transfer system in agriculture, focusing on practical demonstrations and presentation of sustainable farming systems and soil protection in practice. However, the demonstration activities support mostly technological development and some individual ecological measures whereas the sustainability of agriculture as the complex process unifying the crop and animal production is not in the foreground.

This study seeks to understand alternatives to tobacco production from the perspective of government officials, extension officers, and farmers at the sub-national level (Migori, Busia, and Meru) in Kenya. The study analyzes data from qualitative key-informant interviews with government officials and extension officers (n = 9) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with farmers (n = 5). Data were coded according to pre-identified categories derived from the research aim, namely, opportunities and challenges of tobacco farming and alternative crops, as well findings that illustrate the policy environment that shapes the agricultural context in these regions. We highlight important factors associated with the production of non-tobacco agricultural commodities, including the factors that shape the ability of these non-agricultural commodities to serve as viable alternatives to tobacco. The results highlight the effect that several factors, including access to capital, markets, and governmental assistance, have on farmer decisions. The results additionally display the structured policy approaches that are being promoted in governmental offices towards agricultural production, as well as the institutional shortcomings that inhibit their implementation at the sub-national level.

We used the water footprint theory to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics and variation in the water footprint of agriculture and livestock (WF-AL) in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region of China (2000\u20132016). We predicted the spatial distribution and sustainability of regional water resources at different levels of annual precipitation. Results showed that the average county WF-AL rose from 8.03 \u00d7 108 m3 in 2000 to 10.89 \u00d7 108 m3 in 2016. There was spatial heterogeneity compared to the average city WF-AL. The WF-AL varied between the mountains and the plains. The scale of the WF-AL was one of the main reasons for differences in the consumption and distribution of water resources. The development of regional water resources deteriorated from a stable state to an unstable state from 2000 to 2016. Only 5.8% of the areas maintained a stable state of water resources. Even in the predicted wet years, no improvements were found in the instability of water resources in four areas centered on the counties of Xinji, Daming, Luannan, and Weichang. To achieve a medium and long-term balance between WF-AL development and water resource recovery, the WF-AL should be limited and combined with reservoir and cross-regional water transfer.

This concept is directly related to bioeconomy. Spain implemented its own strategy in bioeconomy in 2016, affecting all economic activities, agriculture included. In line with this, one of the most important agricultural sectors is the greenhouse horticulture of Almer\u00eda (SE Spain). This region has experienced deep changes in the last 40 years, and has become one of the most efficient agro-industrial complexes in the world. This rapid growth has brought sustainability problems such as pollution, water overuse, or inadequate waste management. Several studies have undertaken organic waste reuse or minimization, but an important lack of knowledge exists regarding the inorganic fraction. One of the goals of the REINWASTE project is to find solutions for this problem. Therefore, an extensive legal framework has been consulted and an in-depth study of the steps in greenhouse production with the associated residues has been carried out. Additionally, information from experts and stakeholders has been registered, resulting a list of Best Available Technologies (BATs) to prevent and minimize inorganic waste generation.

Humic acid (HA) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are among the most effective methods that utilize natural biologically-active substances. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of the presence of HA on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) inoculation with PGPR (Bacillus megatorium and Bacillus subtilis) when compared to control and recommended doses of NPK. Seed tubers treated by humic acid (200, 400, and 600 kg ha\u22121) and PGPR, separately or in combination, and NPK (50% and 100%) were planted into soil and untreated soil. Treatments were assessed for plant growth, classified tuber yields, quality, and mineral contents of potato tubers. There were highly significant increases in potato growth, tuber yields, and quality in PGPR and HA inoculated crops. Tuber size, weight, specific gravity, dry matter, starch, protein, and mineral contents (except Cu) were improved with PGPR treatments and further increased when administered with humic acids. Inoculation with PGPR mixed culture and 400 kg ha\u22121 HA increased total potato tuber yield by about 140% while conventional single treatment of 100% NPK fertilizer only led to an increase in potato production of 111% when compared to the control.

This research aims to gain a better understanding of CSA farmers\u2019 perceived benefits and drawbacks in managing a CSA farm, and whether CSA management perception varies in different countries. The research collected data from 35 farmers that were based in the United States (US) and Hungary (HU). Data elaboration includes a one-way Anova test, Chi-square test, principal component analysis, and multiple multivariate linear regressions. The results support that US and HU farmers have similar positive perceptions of CSA farming management, especially in food quality, nutritional value products, environmental, and community benefits. The main differences concentrate on economic, financial, and management perceptions. CSA success as an alternative agro-food production and distribution system relies on the capability to involve CSA members. Therefore, CSA farmers\u2019 management skills may evolve to ensure the performance of communication and community engaging practices. The main CSA concern is ensuring a fair income and living wage for the farmers and labor force. There is a need for better balancing non-monetary and monetary benefits for the farmers.

Green manures are known as a good alternative to the use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides. They are an important source of nitrogen and reduce significantly weed invasion. Nevertheless, the literature providing a precise quantification of total nutrients available for plants after incorporation of leguminous species cultivated in Portugal is scarce. This lake of knowledge\u2019s makes farmers worried about hypothetic productivity loss, making them to use excessive complementary amounts of mineral fertilizer. Providing farmers with tools to calculated accurately the reduction of mineral fertilizer will increase their gain and avoid environmental pollution by nutrients lixiviation. Under the scope the international H2020 SoilCare project, a study was conducted during the winter and spring of 2018\u20132019 at Baixo Mondego valley in Central Portugal, where the main land use is the monoculture of irrigated corn. The nutrient uptake was determined for 5 species of legumes: pre-inoculated Pea (Pisum sativum L.); Yellow Lupin (Lupinus luteus), Red Clover (Trifolium pratense); Balansa Clover (Trifolium michelianum); Arrowleaf Clover (Trifolium vesiculosum) and a control (natural vegetation). For each treatment, we determined total dry matter yield for leguminous and weeds, macronutrients uptake (N and P Total, K, Na, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients uptake (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn). Combining soil analyses, theoretical main crop needs in nutrients (short cycle grain maize) and mineralization rates, we calculated the precise amendment needed to obtain the expected yield of maize in what concerns the macronutrient. The production of total dry matter (leguminous and weeds) was very similar for the 5 treatments e.g., about 7 ton/ha. Nevertheless, considering leguminous production, the higher dry matter yields was obtain for the Arrowleaf Clover and the lower for the Red Clover respectively 5.5 and 3.5 ton/ha. The Macronutrient content (N,P,K) of the leguminous ranged between 22.9 and 28.0 g/kg for N, 2.4 and 3.1 g/kg for P and 12.1 and 31.5 g/kg for K. The Yellow Lupin presented the higher values of N, the clovers the higher values of P and K. The total quantity of macronutrients incorporated in the soil was in average 152 kg/ha for N, 20 kg/ha for P and 170 kg/ha for K with the higher quantities for Arrowleaf Clover. We considered a mineralization coefficient of 0.5 for N and 0.6 for P during the first year and a nutrient extraction of 280 kg/ha of N, 50 kg/ha of P and 245 kg/ha of K, for a production yield of 12 t/ha of corn grain. After correction of plant needs following the soil analyses results, we determinate an optimized fertilization rate of 180-40-0, were the green manure supplies about 35%, 25% and 100% of the NPK extraction of the grain maize.", "Aotearoa\u2014New Zealand (NZ) is internationally renowned for picturesque landscapes and agricultural products. Agricultural intensification has been economically beneficial to NZ but has implications for its clean green image. Contaminated waterways, high carbon emissions, and extensive soil erosion demonstrate the downside of high stocking rates and land clearing. Transformative farming systems are required to address the challenge of balancing production with the environment. Whilst navigating through the process of change, farmers need to be supported to make informed decisions at the farm and landscape scale. Landscape ecology (LE) is ideally positioned to inform the development of future farming landscapes and provide a scientific context to the criteria against which land-related information can be evaluated. However, to do this effectively, LE needs to demonstrate that it can link theory with practice. Using NZ as a case example, this paper discusses the key roles for LE in future farming systems. It looks at the way LE can help quantify the state of the landscape, provide support towards the co-creation of alternative futures, and assist with the inclusion of land-related information into design and planning to ensure mitigation and adaption responses assist in the transformation of farming systems for sustainable outcomes.

In the framework of the ADAPT2CLIMA project, the available techniques and methods implemented worldwide for the adaptation of six crops (wheat, barley, potatoes, tomatoes, grapes, and olives) to climate change impacts were thoroughly assessed. The identified adaptation options were categorized according to the climate change impact they address as follows: measures against drought stress, heat stress, decreasing plant health, extreme weather events and reduced crop productivity. Another category that refers to measures that address more than one category of climate change was also added. The evaluation of the identified adaptation options was based on a self-administered semi-structured questionnaire. The identified adaptation measures were graded according to the following criteria: efficiency of the measure, urgency of implementing the measure, usefulness of implementation irrespective of climate change, technical difficulty, contribution to climate change adaptation, economic viability and social acceptance. Fifty-six respondents (experts and stakeholders) filled the questionnaire, suggesting twelve recommended adaptation measures (with high score \u2265 60%), which mainly refer to irrigation adaptation measures, cultural practices, and methods for upgrading external services to farmers. The recommended adaptation measures for Cyprus are thoroughly presented and discussed.

The bulk of this growth will need to come from smallholder farmers who rely on generational knowledge in their farming practices and who live in locations where weather patterns and seasons are becoming less predictable due to climate change. The expansion of internet-connected devices is increasing opportunities to apply digital tools and services on smallholder farms, including monitoring soil and plants in horticulture, water quality in aquaculture, and ambient environments in greenhouses. In combination with other food security efforts, internet of things (IoT)-enabled precision smallholder farming has the potential to improve livelihoods and accelerate low- and middle-income countries\u2019 journey to self-reliance. Using a combination of interviews, surveys and site visits to gather information, this research presents a review of the current state of the IoT for on-farm measurement, cases of successful IoT implementation in low- and middle-income countries, challenges associated with implementing the IoT on smallholder farms, and recommendations for practitioners.

The significance and relevance of SIPs in a Pakistani context demands an investigation. Hence, this study takes the initiative to investigate the determinants regarding the adoption of these practices. Based on the evidence, we selected five SIPs, namely, improved seeds, organic manure, crop rotation, intercropping, and low tillage. Furthermore, this study analyzes the adoption of SIPs with randomly collected data from 612 farmers through multistage sampling. A multivariate probit model (MVP) is employed to analyze the mutually dependent adoption decisions and identify the factors associated with them. The results revealed that education, the area under cultivation, access to information, extension access, social participation, rainfall variability, and temperature increase significantly predict the adoption of SIPs. The adoption of organic manure and crop rotation was highest between all the ecological zones, whereas low tillage was the least adopted practice. Adoption intensity in mixed cropping zones was slightly higher than the other ecological zones. Moreover, the findings also reveal the important synergies amid natural resource management and input-based SIPs. Hence, the study highlights the perseverance and importance of social groups and recommends the government to formulate comprehensive policies to facilitate institutional access and elevate the adoption level amongst the farming community.

However, the development of this groundwater economy is currently associated with an increased pressure on the available resource and negative implications on the socio-ecological system. Managing complex socio-ecological systems, such as those that occur in water resource management, is a multi-actor, multi-scale and dynamic decision-making process. This study aims to build a collective learning and collaborative construction tool through the territory game method. It was implemented in the Haouaria Plain, in Northern Tunisia, where farmers are currently dependent upon groundwater use for their livelihood and food security. After the diagnosis of the territorial issues, the drivers of change and a common spatial representation of the future trend of the territory, we dive into the dimensions that hinder or facilitate the implementation of scenarios and the pathways of actions. Thereafter, we analyzed these dimensions together again and reflect on the interactions among actors at different levels to transform the local territory. From the perspective of evolution scenarios for the Haouaria plain, the participants indicated the conditions that hinder or facilitate their implementation and they proposed twenty-three possible actions to be carried out in order to achieve the desired trends. They indicated how these propositions can be achieved, by whom, and where. The local stakeholders coordinate actors, activities and spaces on their territory. Spaces such as El Gar\u00e2a basin, littoral forest or food processing companies are at stake to develop an integrated response to territorial issues.

It provides raw materials for food and provides large employment opportunities for people in the country, especially for countries with a dense population. To enhance agriculture productivity, modern technology such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be utilized to help in monitoring important parameters in thw agricultural field such as temperature, light, soil moisture, etc. During the monitoring process, if security compromises happen, such as interception or modification of the parameters, it may lead to false decisions and bring damage to agriculture productivity. Therefore, it is very important to develop secure authentication and key agreement for the system. Recently, Ali et al. proposed an authentication and key agreement scheme using WSNs for agriculture monitoring. However, it fails to provide user untraceability, user anonymity, and session key security; it suffers from sensor node impersonation attack and perfect forward secrecy attack; and even worse has denial of service as a service. This study discusses these limitations and proposes a new secure and more efficient authentication and key agreement scheme for agriculture monitoring using WSNs. The proposed scheme utilizes dynamic pseudonym identity to guarantee user privacy and eliminates redundant computations to enhance efficiency.

Smallholder farmers, however, are restricted in the number of crops they can grow due to small plot sizes. Agriculture inputs, such as fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides, and improved seed varieties, could prove to be useful resources to improve yield. Despite the potential of these agriculture technologies, input use throughout much of SSA remains low. This paper aims to better understand the process of innovation diffusion through information and interaction processes at the individual, social network, and community levels. A total of 203 participants were surveyed using a semi-structured interview method in four rural communities located in the Mbale, Lira, Kabale, and Masaka districts of Uganda. Participants were asked about their access to information technologies, information sources via social network ties, level of engagement in the local community, and agricultural input use. Results indicate households with higher levels of information access through cell phone use and weak-tie information sources are more likely to use inputs. Significant findings also include the interactional effect of cell phones and weak ties on fertilizer adoption. This research could inform policy makers of cost-effective methods of disseminating agriculture information and encouraging innovation diffusion.

The Cabo Verde archipelago is characterized by limited resources, remoteness, vulnerability to natural disasters, and a fragile environment. In this study, we provide the first report of the current status and trends of agriculture in Cabo Verde. We present data on the current performance of agricultural production areas in these islands and discuss them in terms of their most important natural constraint, water. Also, we assess the impact of institutional strategies on crop production and evaluate recent mechanisms that have been engaged towards agrarian development in this archipelago. Our results show that, among the ten Cabo Verde Islands, Santiago has the largest area used for agriculture (52.5%), followed by Santo Ant\u00e3o (16%) and Fogo (15.8%), and that rainfed farming dominates in all of them. The staple crops, such as maize and beans, are produced through rainfed subsistence farming, whereas irrigated crops (i.e., sugarcane, tomatoes) are mostly grown for commercial purposes. The prolonged drought periods, exposure, erosion and soil degradation, which led to increasing desertification over the last decades, have been identified as the main constraints to agrarian development across the ten islands of the archipelago. The strategies of Cabo Verde government to mitigate water scarcity through small-scale irrigation based mainly on small dams and drip irrigation technology have a marked effect on agricultural production in the predominantly arid and semi-arid areas of this archipelago.

It is in this context that management decisions must be made, for example with respect to soil fertilization, grazing, or animal supplementation. In this work, the effect of the tree canopy on the spatial and temporal variability of the soil and productivity, quality, and floristic composition of the pasture was evaluated. Precision agriculture (PA) technologies for monitoring soil and pasture were also evaluated. The study was carried out between October 2015 and June 2018 in an experimental field of 2.3 ha. The results showed: (i) The positive impact of trees and animal grazing on soil fertility; (ii) the influence of inter-annual variability of precipitation on the pattern of pasture vegetative cycle; (iii) the positive effect of trees in pasture quality; (iv) the negative effect of trees in pasture productivity; (v) the role of pasture floristic composition as an indicator of soil limitations or climatic changes; (vi) the potential of technologies associated with the concept of PA as express tools to decision making support and for the optimization of the herbaceous stratum and the dynamic management of grazing in this ecosystem in a holistic and sustainable form.

Currently, the main consumer of water globally is agriculture. In addition, it has been estimated that to meet the demand for food by 2050, the water available for agricultural irrigation would have to increase by 70%. In this context, wastewater could become a relevant water resource to meet this growing demand. This article aims to show the state of the global research on sustainable use of wastewater in agriculture. To this end, a systematic qualitative analysis and a quantitative bibliometric analysis were conducted. The search was carried out for the period 2000\u20132019, and the analyzed sample comprised 1986 articles. The results show that this line of research is one of the most outstanding within agriculture and has gained special relevance during the last five years. Research has improved significantly at a technical level, but problems such as energy consumption, and the elimination of heavy metals and elements of chemical and pharmacological products, still need to be refined. There is a particular lack of contributions covering social aspects. This article can serve as a reference for both researchers and stakeholders interested in this topic.

We argue that they should be treated as integrated components of a single complex system that is prone to direct or indirect tradeoffs that should be avoided while also being amenable to synergies that should be sought. Direct tradeoffs such as competition for space or the pollution of shared water resources usually occur when the footprints of agriculture and aquaculture overlap or when the two practices coexist in close proximity to one another. Interactions can be modulated by factors such as hydropower infrastructure and short-term economic incentives, both of which are known to disrupt the balance between aquaculture and agriculture. Indirect tradeoffs, on the other hand, play out across distances, i.e., when agricultural food sources are diverted to feed animals in aquaculture. Synergies are associated with the culture of aquatic organisms in rice paddies and irrigation waters, seasonal rotations of crop cultivation with aquaculture, and various forms of integrated agriculture\u2013aquaculture (IAA), including jitang, a highly developed variant of pond-dike IAA. Policy decisions, socioeconomic considerations, and technology warrant increased scrutiny as determinants of tradeoffs and synergies. Priority issues for the future include guiding the expansion of aquaculture from its traditional base in Asia, taking advantage of the heterogeneity that exists within both agricultural and aquaculture systems, the development of additional metrics of tradeoffs and synergies, and adapting to the effects of climate change.

This paper studies the economic resilience of Austrian agriculture within the period of 1995 to 2019. However, methods for tracking changes in economic resilience have so far seen only limited application in agriculture. The index for the analysis and measurement of economic resilience is based on four areas: financial flexibility, stability in following the development path, diversification of activities, and diversification of export markets. As results show, Austrian agriculture is of interest because of the very high level of economic resilience, ranging from 0.83 to 0.92 in the period researched, thereby displaying a high capacity to absorb shocks. Generally, these results indicate that Austrian agriculture is forgiving of shocks and thus very economically resilient. These results provide context for developing generalizations on economic resilience in agriculture and its fundamental function for producing effective food security within a sustainable transition path. Some concluding suggestions propose possible future areas of research. View Full-Text", "Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015\u20132020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and discussion of climate change impacts on water and agriculture sectors and implications for the attainment of developmental outcomes such as food security, poverty reduction, and sustainable development in Southern Africa. The review gives policy messages for coping, adapting, and building resilience of water and agricultural production systems in the face of projected changes in climate and variability. The aim is to guide the region towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Future projections for Southern Africa indicate reduced rainfall, increased temperatures, and high variability for the greater part of the region with severe reductions on the drier and marginal western parts. These impacts have profound implications for agriculture performance and contribution to national and regional developmental goals. The region is projected to experience reductions of between 15% and 50% in agricultural productivity, a scenario that would exacerbate food insecurity in the region. The challenge is to increase productivity on current arable land through efficient and sustainable management of available water and energy, and at the same time reducing pressure on the environment. Affordability and accessibility of innovative adaptation measures on water resources remain critical and these strategies should be part of broader sustainable development efforts. Overall, efforts to enhance agricultural productivity need to emphasise investments in sustainable management and use of water and energy resources in agriculture to achieve sustainable economic growth and livelihoods.

Such projects aim to cope with the challenge of sustainable urban development and today the sustainability of the projects is questioned. To date, no set of criteria has been designed to specifically assess the environmental, social and economic sustainability of these farms at the farm scale. Our study aims to identify sustainability objectives and criteria applicable to professional intra-urban farms. It relies on a participatory approach involving various stakeholders of the French urban agriculture sector comprising an initial focus group, online surveys and interviews. We obtained a set of six objectives related to environmental impacts, link to the city, economic and ethical meaning, food and environmental education, consumer/producer connection and socio-territorial services. In addition, 21 criteria split between agro-environmental, socio-territorial and economic dimensions were identified to reach these objectives. Overall, agro-environmental and socio-territorial criteria were assessed as more important than economic criteria, whereas food production was not mentioned. Differences were identified between urban farmers and decision makers, highlighting that decision makers were more focused on projects\u2019 external sustainability. They also pay attention to the urban farmer agricultural background, suggesting that they rely on urban farmers to ensure the internal sustainability of the farm. Based on our results, indicators could be designed to measure the sustainability criteria identified, and to allow the sustainability assessment of intra-urban farms.

In this study, the solution developed addresses countries characterised by relatively small farms, vast spatial and temporal variability and severe data scarcity. The proposed model-based approach is directly relevant to the evaluation of agricultural policies affecting water abstraction based on multisource data. The evaluation process utilises an entirely spatially distributed, continuous hydrological model. The model provides a gridded output of the main hydrological balance components, as well as vegetation water deficit and irrigation water requirements, on a daily temporal step on a country scale. It provides information at the farm level and facilitates the estimation of water abstractions in agriculture, taking into consideration all the pertinent information included in the Integrated Administration and Control System database that is maintained by RDPs in Europe. Remote sensing data also are used to validate crop patterns. The obtained results were analysed to estimate the net effect of the RDP to the reduction of water abstractions in agriculture.

We use CO2 emissions from the agriculture sector as a proxy indicator for environmental quality. We employ various unit root tests (e.g., ADF, PP, ERS, KPSS) and structural break unit root tests (Z&A, CMR) to check the stationarity and structural break in the data series. Cointegration tests, i.e., Johansen, Engle-Granger, and ARDL cointegration approaches are used to ensure their robustness. Results showed that significant long-term cointegration exists among the variables. Findings also indicated that an increase in financial development and foreign direct investment (FDI) improves environmental quality, whereas the increase in economic growth and electricity consumption in the agriculture sector degrades environmental quality in Pakistan. Based on the findings, we suggest policymakers should provide a conducive environment for foreign investment. Moreover, it is also suggested that a reliance on fossil fuels be reduced and a transition to renewable energy sources be encouraged to decrease the environmental pollution in the country.

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) is a unique local food channel adopted by producers that was initially established as a strategy for producers to directly benefit from the season-long investments of buyers who align with their community-focused mission. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture has long collected data to improve farm performance, information on specific marketing channels is missing, and in response, this research provides some of the first evidence of the heterogeneity of performance among CSAs. In a pilot approach to understanding the economics of CSAs relative to other direct marketing channels, we conducted an assessment process, incorporating 42 farms in Colorado between June 2016 and October 2017. Results showed that farms that incorporated CSA sales in their direct market portfolios tended to be smaller in scale and utilize more diverse markets. Although these CSA farms have lower average weekly sales, they have the highest average marketing profit margins compared to other direct market channels.

To maximise the multifunctionality of these farms, entrepreneurial or innovative farm diversification is important. However, there is insufficient research on this issue in developed countries. This study aims to demonstrate the existence of advanced diversified farms characterised by entrepreneurship, skilled farm management and social networks and explore their economic and social sustainability by using data from a survey of 386 farms located close to urban areas in Japan. Gaussian mixture clustering analysis revealed that only about 10% of the sample can be classified as advanced diversified farms and most of the other diversified farms do not exhibit entrepreneurial attributes. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that advanced diversification has a positive impact not only on the economic viability of farms, but also on their social performance. These findings have significant implications for policies promoting the sustainability of urban agriculture, suggesting that a more balanced promotion of the diversification and entrepreneurial attributes of farms is crucial to building a sustainable relationship between cities and urban agriculture.

Agriculture in these regions is threatened by increases in the occurrence of drought and high temperature events associated with climate change (CC). In this review we analyze what would be the effects of CC on crops (including orchards and vineyards), how crops and cropping and farming systems could adapt to CC, and what are the social and economic impacts, as well as the strategies used by producers to adapt to CC. In rainfed areas, water deficit occurs mostly during the flowering and grain filling stages (terminal drought stress), which has large detrimental effects on the productivity of crops. Orchards and vineyards, which are mostly cultivated in irrigated areas, will also be vulnerable to water deficit due to a reduction in water available for irrigation and an increase in evapotranspiration. Adaptation of agriculture to CC in MCRs requires integrated strategies that encompass different levels of organization: the crop (including orchards and vineyards), the cropping system (sequence of crops and management techniques used on a particular agricultural field) and the farming system, which includes the farmer.

However, the increased production cost of planting green manure reduces farmers\u2019 willingness to adopt this approach, which is unfavorable for its sustainability. This research aims to investigate the influence of instrumental variables on farmers\u2019 perceptions of sustainable agriculture practices, especially the use of rotation fallow, and tries to understand the relationship between farmers\u2019 perceptions of using rotation fallow and planting green manure under incentive measures adopted by local authorities in Guangxi Province, China. Using simultaneous equation models, the results show that subsidies and planting training were the most important drivers for restoring green manure planting in the target region. These incentive measures could be further enhanced as a priority to restore green manure planting. The study also finds that socioeconomic factors such as farmer\u2019s income, area of farmland, and labor for agricultural production have a certain influence on planting green manure planting and on farmers\u2019 perceptions of using rotation fallow as a form of sustainable agriculture practice.

These actions aim to promote the integration of renewables and the reduction of emissions in all sectors. Among the different sectors, agriculture emerges as a remarkable opportunity to integrate these proposals. Indeed, this sector accounts for 10% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU, representing 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. Within the agriculture sector, current solutions for groundwater pumping purposes are mainly based on diesel technologies, leading to a remarkable fossil fuel dependence and emissions that must be reduced to fulfill both energy and environmental requirements. Relevant actions must be proposed that are focused on sustainable strategies and initiatives. Under this scenario, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into groundwater pumping installations has recently been considered as a suitable solution. However, this approach requires a more extended analysis, including different risks and impacts related to sustainability from the economic and energy points of view, and by considering other relevant aspects such as environmental consequences. In addition, PV solar power systems connected to the grid for groundwater pumping purposes provide a relevant opportunity to optimize the power supplied by these installations in terms of self-consumption and net-metering advantages. Actually, the excess PV power might be injected to the grid, with potential profits and benefits for the agriculture sector. Under this scenario, the present paper gives a multidimensional analysis of PV solar power systems connected to the grid for groundwater pumping solutions, including net-metering conditions and benefit estimations that are focused on a Spanish case study.

Although several attempts have been made to evaluate urban agriculture production, few studies have investigated food production in a multitemporal geospatial way and considered per capita population needs, gender, and age strata consumption. This study presents a spatiotemporal quantification of urban agriculture in the city of Milan (Italy) for assessing food self-provisioning potential. We utilized high-resolution Google Earth images and ancillary data to create a detailed cadaster of urban agriculture for the years 2007 and 2014. Based on four scenarios of food production and statistical data on vegetables and cereals consumption, we estimated current total production and requirements for the city dwellers. Our results showed that the actual extension of vegetable gardens (98 ha) and arable land (2539 ha) in the best scenario could satisfy approximately 63,700 and 321,000 consumers of vegetables and cereal products, respectively. Overall, current urban agriculture production is not able to meet vegetables and cereal consumption for more than 1.3 million city residents.

In this paper, we advanced and demonstrated the practical use and application of a mobile smartphone-based tool, i.e., the Open Data Kit (ODK), to assemble and keep track of real-time maize (Zea mays L.) phenological data in three SSA countries. Farmers, extension agents, researchers, and other stakeholders were enlisted to participate in an initiative to demonstrate the applicability of mobile smartphone-based apps and open-source servers for rapid data collection and management. A pre-installed maize phenology data application based on the ODK architecture was provided to the participants (n = 75) for maize data collection and management over the maize growing season period in 2015\u20132017. The application structure was custom designed based on maize developmental stages such as planting date, date of emergence, date of first flowering, anthesis, grain filling, and maturity. Results showed that in Ethiopia, early maturing varieties took 105 days from sowing to maturity in low altitudes, whereas late-maturing varieties took up to 190 days to complete developmental stages in high altitude areas. In Tanzania, a similar trend was observed, whereas in Nigeria, most existing varieties took an average of 100 days to complete their developmental stages. Furthermore, the data showed that the durations from sowing to emergence, emergence to flowering, flowering to maturity were mainly dependent on temperature. The values of growing degree for each phase of development obtained from different planting dates were almost constant for each maize variety, which showed that temperature and planting time are the main elements affecting the rate of maize development. The data aggregation approach using the ODK and on-farm personnel improved efficiency and convenience in data collection and visualization. Our study demonstrates that this system can be used in crop management and research on many spatial scales, i.e., local, regional, and continental, with relatively high data collation accuracy.

This article presents an augmented reality tool that allows for improved spatial viewing for students who have certain difficulties with viewing graphic representations of agronomic systems and devices. This tool is known as ARTID (Augmented Reality for Teaching, Innovation and Design) and consists in a free-access mobile application for devices using the Android operating system. The proposed method provides each exploded drawing or overall drawing with a QR code that can be used by students to view their 3D models by augmented reality in their own mobile devices. An evaluation experience was carried out to assess the validity of the tool on different devices and the acceptance and satisfaction level of this kind of resources in subjects of graphic expression in engineering. Finally, an example of application in the agronomic domain is provided by the 3D virtual model of portable ferticontrol equipment that comprises the different structures and tanks, which, if viewed by conventional graphical representations, may entail a certain level of difficulty. Thanks to this tool, reality can be merged with the virtual world to help favour the understanding of certain concepts and to increase student motivation in agronomy studies.

Among PBCs, Miscanthus grasses with C4 photosynthesis combine high yield potentials and water use efficiencies. However, the standard commercial clone M. x giganteus (Mxg), with minimal stomatal regulation, is too sensitive to drought for reliable yields in the Mediterranean regions. This paper screened a diverse panel of thirteen Miscanthus genotypes (M. sinensis, M. floridulus, M. sacchariflorus and Mxg) to identify which types could maximize yield under summer drought conditions typical in the South Mediterranean climate. In the second growing season, significant differences were observed for plant height (from 63 to 185 cm), stem number (from 12 to 208 stems plant\u22121), biomass yield (from 0.17 to 6.4 kg DM plant\u22121) and whole crop water use efficiency (from 0.11 to 7.0 g L\u22121). Temporal variation in net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and instantaneous water use efficiency identified different strategies adopted by genotypes, and that genotypes selected from M. floridulus and M. sinensis were better adapted to rainfed conditions and could produce six times more biomass than the Mxg. These accessions are being used as parents in experimental breeding aimed at producing future seed-based drought resilient hybrids.

This study was carried out to understand the effects of zinc (Zn), boron (B), and molybdenum (Mo) on the growth and yield of lentil, and how these elements can help manage soil fertility issues. In this regard, the morpho-physiological traits of lentils (BARI Masur-7) were collected from two experiments receiving the same treatments carried out during consecutive rabi seasons of 2015\u20132016 and 2016\u20132017. The experiments were laid out with a randomized complete block design having eight treatments, and was replicated thrice. The treatments were T1 (Control), T2 (Zn2.0 kg ha\u22121), T3 (B1.5 kg ha\u22121), T4 (Mo1.0 kg ha\u22121), T5 (Zn2.0B1.5 kg ha\u22121), T6 (Zn2.0Mo1.0 kg ha\u22121), T7 (B1.5Mo1.0 kg ha\u22121), and T8 (Zn2.0B1.5Mo1.0 kg ha\u22121). The results revealed that the application of micronutrients either singly or in combination had significant effects on the plant height, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, thousand seed weight, and the seed yield of lentil. The maximum seed production was, however, observed in plots receiving treatment T8, i.e., the combined application of Zn, B, and Mo. Agronomic biofortification also had significantly increased protein content of lentil seeds while affecting the macro and micronutrient content of lentil seed. These results suggest that any micronutrient deficiencies might lead to a yield loss of lentil, and such a scenario could be avoided by a combined application of micronutrients at a proportionate level.

Such information is a critical input for any site-specific weed management program. A multi-rotor UAS (Phantom 4) equipped with an RGB sensor was used to collect imagery in three bands (Red, Green, and Blue; 0.8 cm/pixel resolution) with the objectives of (a) mapping weeds in cotton and (b) determining the relationship between image-based weed coverage and ground-based weed densities. For weed mapping, three different weed density levels (high, medium, and low) were established for a mix of different weed species, with three replications. To determine weed densities through ground truthing, five quadrats (1 m \u00d7 1 m) were laid out in each plot. The aerial imageries were preprocessed and subjected to Hough transformation to delineate cotton rows. Following the separation of inter-row vegetation from crop rows, a multi-level classification coupled with machine learning algorithms were used to distinguish intra-row weeds from cotton. Overall, accuracy levels of 89.16%, 85.83%, and 83.33% and kappa values of 0.84, 0.79, and 0.75 were achieved for detecting weed occurrence in high, medium, and low density plots, respectively. Further, ground-truthing based overall weed density values were fairly correlated (r2 = 0.80) with image-based weed coverage assessments. Among the specific weed species evaluated, Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) showed the highest correlation (r2 = 0.91) followed by red sprangletop (Leptochloa mucronata Michx) (r2 = 0.88). The results highlight the utility of UAS-borne RGB imagery for weed mapping and density estimation in cotton for precision weed management.

However, such omnipresent and likely important interactions for viruses and bacteria relevant to the applied and agricultural sciences have not been reviewed or compiled. The fundamental basis of this review is that these interactions have importance and deserve more investigation, as numerous potential consequences and applications arising from their discovery are relevant to the applied sciences. The purpose of this review is to highlight and summarize eukaryotic virus\u2013bacteria findings in the food/water, horticultural, and animal sciences. In many cases in the agricultural sciences, mechanistic understandings of the effects of virus\u2013bacteria interactions remain unstudied, and many studies solely focus on co-infections of bacterial and viral pathogens. Given recent findings relative to human viral pathogens, further research related to virus\u2013bacteria interactions would likely result in numerous discoveries and beneficial applications.

We evaluated red clover-maize, maize-soybean, and soybean-wheat/red clover rotations in organic and conventional cropping systems with recommended and high inputs in New York, USA to identify the best rotation and management practices during the transition. Organic compared with conventional maize with recommended inputs in the maize-soybean rotation (entry crop) averaged 32% lower yields, $878/ha higher production costs, and $1096/ha lower partial returns. Organic maize compared with conventional maize with recommended inputs in the red clover-maize rotation (second transition crop) had similar yields, production costs, and partial returns. Organic compared with conventional soybean with recommended inputs in soybean-wheat/red clover or maize-soybean rotations had similar yields, production costs, and partial returns. Organic compared with conventional wheat with recommended inputs in the soybean-wheat/clover rotation had similar yields, $416/ha higher production costs, and $491/ha lower partial returns. The organic compared with the conventional soybean-wheat/red clover rotation had the least negative impact on partial returns during the transition. Nevertheless, all organic rotations had similar partial returns ($434 to $495/ha) so transitioning immediately, regardless of entry crop, may be most prudent. High input management did not improve organic crop yields during the transition.

Husn.), are expected to increase substantially in the coming years, due to the ever-growing human population\u2019s needs for food, feed, and fuel. Thus, providing consistent or increased durum grain to the world market is one of the priorities for policy-makers, researchers, and farmers. What are the major achievements in agronomic advancement for durum wheat cultivation in recent decades? How might the current cropping systems be improved to increase crop yield and quality and improve resource use efficiencies while minimizing input costs and decreasing negative impact on the environment? Canada is one of the major durum wheat producers in the world, as Canada contributes about 50% to global trade of durum grain. Canada\u2019s research achievements in durum wheat might serve as a guide for advancing the cultivation of the crop in other regions/countries on the planet. This review summarizes the major Canadian research findings in the aspects of durum wheat agronomics during the period 2001 to 2017 years. It highlights the main advancements in seeding and tillage, crop rotation and diversification, and use of pulse-induced microbiomes to improve soil health and feedback mechanisms. The genetic gain and breeding for resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses are discussed. Finally, we identified the main constraints and suggested some near-term research priorities. The research findings highlighted in this review will be of use for other areas on the planet to increase durum wheat productivity, improve soil fertility and health, and enhance long-term sustainability.

As such, it does not demand the application of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizer and can offer environmental benefits as part of holistic cropping systems. While common bean commodities are highly nutritious, commercial cultivation of this crop is declining in already-industrialized countries. However, recent interest of consumers towards diets that benefit environmental and personal health has rekindled commercial interest in legumes, including the common bean. The aim of this protocol is to identify agronomic practices that are capable of increasing the yield and quality of the common bean for use as food. To address this research question, published literature will be screened for inclusion on the basis of defined eligibility criteria to ensure data sources are selected in an objective and consistent manner. Consistency checks will be carried out for the title, abstract and full texts of the literature collated. The output is expected to be a summary of the knowledge available to maximize the productivity and quality of the common bean as food. This anticipated synthesis will be of utility for a wide range of value-chain stakeholders from farmers and consumers, to research scientists and policy makers.

Agronomical and basic fruit quality parameters were also determined. At twelve years after budding, significant differences were found between rootstocks for the different agronomic and fruit quality traits evaluated. The Pollizo plum rootstocks Adesoto and PM 105 AD seem to induce higher sweetness to peach fruits, based on soluble solids content, individual (sucrose, fructose and sorbitol) and total sugars. A clear tendency was also observed with the rootstock Adesoto, inducing the highest content of phenolics, flavonoids, vitamin C and relative antioxidant capacity (RAC). Thus, the results of this study demonstrate the significant effect of rootstock on the sugar profile and phytochemical characteristics of peach fruits. In addition, this work shows the importance of the sugar profile, because specific sugars play an important role in peach flavour quality, as well as the studied phytochemical compounds when looking for high quality peaches with enhanced health properties.

This research developed an automatic image processing technique to detect rice crop height based on images taken by a digital camera attached to a field server. The camera acquires rice paddy images daily at a consistent time of day. The images include the rice plants and a marker bar used to provide a height reference. The rice crop height can be indirectly measured from the images by measuring the height of the marker bar compared to the height of the initial marker bar. Four digital image processing steps are employed to automatically measure the rice crop height: band selection, filtering, thresholding, and height measurement. Band selection is used to remove redundant features. Filtering extracts significant features of the marker bar. The thresholding method is applied to separate objects and boundaries of the marker bar versus other areas. The marker bar is detected and compared with the initial marker bar to measure the rice crop height. Our experiment used a field server with a digital camera to continuously monitor a rice field located in Suphanburi Province, Thailand. The experimental results show that the proposed method measures rice crop height effectively, with no human intervention required.

Here we report a comprehensive analysis of a data set derived from farm-surveys and previously published studies in a typical high N input area of China. Using scenario analysis, farmers from both sources were divided into four rice production levels to assess the YG and NUE of smallholder farmers. Farm surveys showed that rice yield and partial factor productivity of applied N (PFPN) averaged 8273 kg ha\u22121 and 23.1 kg kg\u22121 at regional-scale, with a potential increase of 21\u201343% and 33\u201352%, respectively. A wide variation in yield and PFPN across different types of farmer was observed. Optimized N management significantly narrowed YGs by 3.7% and PFPN gap by 63.5% on average based on the published literature. Multiple factors, including excessive N rates, small rice planting area (0.33 ha), the aging (51 years old) and low education level (6 years of education) of the major labor force, can partly explain causes of yield and NUE gaps. These findings provide farm-based evidence that centralized management, good agronomy plus advances in knowledge and technologies are essential for future agricultural development.

Foremost is the availability of arable soils, which have been ravaged by the overuse of fertilizers and detrimental soil management techniques. The maintenance of soil quality and reclamation of marginal soils are urgent priorities. The use of biochar, a carbon-rich, porous material thought to improve various soil properties, is gaining interest. Biochar (BC) is produced through the thermochemical decomposition of organic matter in a process known as pyrolysis. Importantly, the source of organic material, or \u2018feedstock\u2019, used in this process and different parameters of pyrolysis determine the chemical and physical properties of biochar. The incorporation of BC impacts soil\u2013water relations and soil health, and it has been shown to have an overall positive impact on crop yield; however, pre-existing physical, chemical, and biological soil properties influence the outcome. The effects of long-term field application of BC and how it influences the soil microcosm also need to be understood. This literature review, including a focused meta-analysis, summarizes the key outcomes of BC studies and identifies critical research areas for future investigations. This knowledge will facilitate the predictable enhancement of crop productivity and meaningful carbon sequestration.

In general, the midseason N is applied without consideration of the actual crop N status, which may lead to over-fertilization and associated environmental problems. Thus, the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a N recommendation approach using aerial images for Mediterranean paddy rice systems. A two-year rice field experiment was established in northeastern Spain, with different rates of pig slurry (PS) and mineral N fertilizer. Multispectral aerial images were taken at the rice booting stage, and several vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated. The VIs showed strong relationships with yield and the relations significantly differed between the PS and mineral fertilization treatments. The strongest relations with yield were obtained with gMCARINIR, proposed in this study, (R2 = 0.67), GNDVI (R2 = 0.64) and MCARINIR (R2 = 0.64), indicating the importance of including the green band information. The N recommendation approach generated using the VIs information showed a high success (87.5%) in the preliminary evaluation. The economic and environmental analysis showed that this approach provides a useful tool when compared to the usual farmer practices.

Located in the central North China Plain, Hengshui City has experienced a regional groundwater depression cone due to excessive pumping of groundwater, resulting in the largest overdraft area in the North China Plain. Since 2014, Hebei Province has adopted measures to realize the comprehensive governance of groundwater overdraft in partial areas of Hengshui City, including adjusting planting structures, promoting agronomic water-saving techniques, strengthening hydraulic engineering construction, and innovative management systems. These measures have been in effect for two years, such that their effectiveness must be assessed for the beneficial recovery of groundwater levels to determine the means for their continuation and extension. However, the change in regional groundwater levels is not gradual, but reflects a process of sudden increase due to the intervention of government behavior, and many existing groundwater recharge models are difficult to apply. Therefore, establishing a reasonable, scientific evaluation system of the measures is a key problem that requires a solution. Using field surveys and experiments, this study establishes a quantitative analysis evaluation method to assess the performance of governance measures adopted by Hengshui City in 2015, with full consideration of the crop water demand process and rainfall frequency. The results show that governance measures had a significant positive outcome on reducing groundwater overdraft in pilot areas. Approximately 98.4% of the agricultural governance target was achieved, with confined groundwater rebounding by approximately 4.92 m as compared to 2015. According to the analysis, the three most efficient measures (the top three largest amounts of groundwater-saved per mu) adopted by the government were (1) non-agricultural crops replacement (forestry), (2) planting pattern adjustments, and (3) integration of water and fertilizer-vegetable, which can be promoted in future measures. However, considering the size of the implementation area and total governance capacity, water-saving during spring irrigation of wheat and replacement by surface water are the two most important conservation measures, which are required to further strengthen the management and implementation effect.

Field experiments were performed in Vitis vinifera L. vines to study the effect of the previously described stomata-closing compound (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate (HB). Exogenous treatments at different doses were periodically carried out using a randomized block design. Firstly, we observed that HB was able to induce stomatal closure in grapevine plants. Under field conditions, the application of HB around veraison induced a higher color intensity in berries, and vines treated at higher doses reached this stage earlier than the un-treated controls. There was also a clear increase in both grape anthocyanin concentration and total soluble solids without having a negative impact on total yield. We therefore, confirm the role of HB as a universal natural stomatal closure compound and propose a new use for HB in viticulture as a ripening inducer, by accelerating anthocyanin accumulation.

To identify the DNA segment that codes for early maturity, a tetraploid potato segregation population of \u201cZhongshu 19\u201d \u00d7 \u201cZhongshu 3\u201d was genetically analyzed, using a combination of high throughput simplified genome sequencing (2b-RAD) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA). The DNA segment related to the early-maturity trait was identified at the 3.7~4.2 Mb locus on the short arm of chromosome 5. Eight molecular markers were developed, of which five were closely linked to the early-maturity trait loci. Additionally, 42 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers were constructed based on the reference sequence of Solanum tuberosum group Phureja DM1-3 516 R44 (DM). Using the TetraploidMap software, the linkage map of chromosome 5 was constructed with 50 markers. The total map length was 172 centiMorgan (cM), with an average genetic distance of 3.44 cM. Correlating molecular and phenotypic data of the segregating population, the mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 5 contributed to 33.55% of the early-maturity phenotype. The early-maturity QTL was located at 84 cM, flanked by the SSR5-85-1 and SCAR5-8 markers. The QTL was fine-mapped to 471 kb. Using DNA sequence annotation, 34 genes were identified in this region, 12 of them with unknown function. Among the other 22 annotated genes, E3 ubiquitin ligase gene PUB14 could be related to maturity and regulation of tuber formation. The constructed QTL map is a useful basic tool for the cloning of early-maturity related genes in tetraploid potatoes.

Thus, these crop plants are essential in terms of global food security. We conducted a bibliometric assessment of scientific documents and patents related to wheat and barley through the Scopus database. The number of documents published per year, their affiliation and corresponding scientific areas, the publishing journals, document types and languages were metricized. The main keywords included in research publications concerning these crops were also analysed globally and clustered in thematic groups. In the case of keywords related to agronomy or genetics and molecular biology, we considered documents dated up to 1999, and from 2000 to 2018, separately. Comparison of the results obtained for wheat and barley revealed some remarkable different trends, for which the underlying reasons are further discussed.

However, optimal P rates vary substantially when different targets such as maximum yield or maximum economic benefit are considered. The present study used field experiment conducted at 36 experiments sites for maize to determine the impact of P application levels on grain yield, plant P uptake, and P agronomy efficiency (AEP), P-derived yield benefits and private profitability, and to evaluated the agronomically (AOPR), privately (POPR), and economically (EOPR) optimal P rate at a regional scale. Four treatments were compared: No P fertilizer (P0); P rate of 45\u201360 kg ha\u22121 (LP); P rate of 90\u2013120 kg ha\u22121 (MP); P rate of 135\u2013180 kg ha\u22121 (HP). P application more effectively increased grain yield, reaching a peak at MP treatment. The plant P uptake in HP treatment was 37.4% higher than that in P0. The relationship between P uptake by plants (y) and P application rate (x) can be described by the equation y = \u22120.0003x2 + 0.1266x + 31.1 (R2 = 0.309, p < 0.01). Furthermore, grain yield (y) and plant P uptake (x) across all treatments also showed a significant polynomial function (R2 = 0.787\u20130.846). The MP treatment led to highest improvements in P agronomic efficiency (AEP), P-derived yield benefits (BY) and private profitability (BP) compared with those in other treatments. In addition, the average agronomically (AOPR), privately (POPR), and economically optimal P rate (EOPR) in 36 experimental sites were suggested as 127.9 kg ha\u22121, 110.8 kg ha\u22121, and 114.4 kg ha\u22121, which ranged from 80.6 to 211.3 kg ha\u22121, 78.2 to 181.8 kg ha\u22121, and 82.6 to 151.6 kg ha\u22121, respectively. Economically optimal P application (EOPR) can be recommended, because EOPR significantly reduced P application compared with AOPR, and average economically optimal yield was slightly higher compared with the average yield in the MP treatment. This study was conducive in providing a more productive, use-effective, profitable, environment-friendly P fertilizer management strategy for supporting maximized production potential and environment sustainable development.

The rural agriculture-dependent communities of SSA are the hardest hit by food and energy scarcity and the impact is felt most by communities in the dryland farming areas. In terms of energy supply appropriate measures and interventions are required to address this challenge. Jatropha curcas L. oil fast tracked itself from obscurity to prominence. Its main advantage is the high content of methyl ester (or bio-diesel). It conforms to EN 14214 specifications, exhibiting emission reduction potential and qualifying as a lucrative bio-diesel alternative to fossil diesel. This paper proposes a focus on Jatropha technology as a holistic approach to tackling the land, energy and food degradation challenges in unison for dry-land SSA. The new Jatropha strategy would be innovative and environmentally friendly soil resource recapitalization and supply feed stock for rural energy generation while fulfilling the criteria of delivering other benefits, such as addressing land use conflict for food and energy production", "Water-saving irrigation development level (WIDL) refers to reasonably and accurately judging a water-saving area based on the analysis of all factors affecting the water-saving irrigation development. The evaluation of regional WIDL is the premise of scientific planning guidance to irrigation work. How to select reasonable evaluation indexes and build a scientific and comprehensive model to evaluate WIDL is of great significance. In this study, the comprehensive evaluation index system of WIDL in 21 cities (states) of the Sichuan province in China (a typical humid region in southern China) was constructed, and the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method was improved to evaluate WIDL. Results showed that the overall development level of water-saving irrigation was \u201cpoor\u201d in Sichuan province. The water-saving irrigation level turned out to be \u201cgood\u201d in three regions with advantageous geographical conditions and developed economies, \u201cgeneral\u201d in four regions with good economic levels where agronomy water saving has been popularized, and \u201cpoor\u201d in fourteen regions of mountainous and hilly areas, especially Ganzi, Aba, and Liangshan, located in the Northwest plateau of Sichuan province, with poor natural resources and insufficient economies. The evaluation results were in good agreement with the actual situation, and in this area, there is enormous potential for the development of water-saving irrigation strategies. This study provides an important technical approach for the evaluation of water-saving irrigation development in humid regions of Southern China.

(jatropha) is highly promoted as oilseed crop for biodiesel production and for climate change mitigation, but cultivation practices require further research. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of varying plant spacings (2.0 m \u00d7 4 m compared to 1.5 m \u00d7 4 m), crop establishment methods (raising plantlets in a nursery prior to planting to the field compared to direct sowing) and genotypes on seed yield, seed quality and plant height, recorded at a dry-subhumid location in Madagascar (Ihosy) and at a humid location in Cameroon (Batchenga). Averaged across treatment variants and genotypes, seed yield and seed oil content were higher at the dry-subhumid site and in particular the narrower spacing reached higher seed yields per unit area than the wider spacing. At the humid site, plant growth was characterized by strong accumulation of biomass. The establishment method tested at the dry-subhumid site showed no significant differences in the recorded parameters. Our results encourage to re-think common practices in jatropha cultivation and underpin the importance of the correct choice of location, genotype and agronomic practices considering the interactions between all factors.

In the present study, we investigated the individual and combined effect of drought and heat stress on growth, photosynthesis, oxidative damage, and gene expression in A. sieberi alba. Drought and heat stress triggered oxidative damage by increasing the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, and therefore electrolyte leakage. The accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as phenol and flavonoids, and proline, mannitol, inositol, and sorbitol, was increased due to drought and heat stress exposure. Photosynthetic attributes including chlorophyll synthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, photosynthetic efficiency, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were drastically reduced due to drought and heat stress exposure. Relative water content declined significantly in stressed plants, which was evident by the reduced leaf water potential and the water use efficiency, therefore, affecting the overall growth performance. Relative expression of aquaporin (AQP), dehydrin (DHN1), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA), osmotin (OSM-34), and heat shock proteins (HSP70) were significantly higher in stressed plants. Drought triggered the expression of AQP, DHN1, LEA, and OSM-34 more than heat, which improved the HSP70 transcript levels. A. sieberi alba responded to drought and heat stress by initiating key physio-biochemical and molecular responses, which were distinct in plants exposed to a combination of drought and heat stress.

We use agronomic crop production, water withdrawal, and energy consumption data to estimate groundwater withdrawal from electric-powered irrigation wells and examine agronomic productivity in Iran\u2019s 31 provinces through the lens of GEF nexus. The ex-post GEF analysis sheds light on some of the root causes of the nation\u2019s worsening water shortage problems. Access to highly subsidized water (surface water and groundwater) and energy has been the backbone of agricultural expansion policies in Iran, supporting employment in agrarian communities. Consequently, water use for agronomic crop production has greatly overshot the renewable water supply capacity of the country, making water bankruptcy a serious national security threat. Significant groundwater table decline across the country and increasing energy consumption underscore dysfunctional feedback relations between agricultural water and energy price and groundwater withdrawal in an inefficient agronomic sector. Thus, it is essential to implement holistic policy reforms aimed at reducing agricultural water consumption to alleviate the looming water bankruptcy threats, which can lead to the loss of numerous agricultural jobs in the years to come.

The accuracy of characterizing SWC has been tested primarily on a small-scale and has received little attention from the scientific community at the field scale. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the characterization of the spatial distribution of soil water content at the field scale by the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). In evaluating the current aim, ECa survey was compared against repeated measurements of SWC at five depths using neutron probe. Results showed that mean SWC was different across ECa derived management zones, which indicates that on a macro-scale, soil ECa could effectively characterize the mean differences in SWC across management zones. Results also showed that deep ECa (0\u2013150 cm) survey outperformed shallow survey (0\u201375 cm). Considering other soil properties, such as organic matter content and salt content, further improved the relationship between SWC and ECa.

However, information on the genetic control of yield-related traits is still limited. In this study, we aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for canopy temperature and chlorophyll content index during anthesis (CTa and CCIa, respectively), the mid grain-filling stage (CTg1 and CCIg1, respectively), and the late grain-filling stage (CTg2 and CCIg2, respectively) as well as for plant height (PH), thousand kernels weight (TKW), and grain yield (GY) using genome-wide linkage mapping. To this end, a double haploid population derived from a cross between two high yielding wheat cultivars, UI Platinum and SY Capstone, was phenotyped in four irrigated environments and genotyped using the wheat 90K iSelect platform and simple sequence repeats. The genotypic data were used to construct a high-density genetic map of 43 linkage groups (LGs) with a total length of 3594.0 cm and a marker density of 0.37 cm. A total of 116 QTL for all nine traits was detected on 33 LGs, spreading to all wheat chromosomes, except for Chr. 7D. Of these, six QTL (CTa.ui-4B.1, Q.CTg1.ui-5B-2.1, Q.CTg2.ui-6B.1, Q.PH.ui-6A-2.1, Q.TKW.ui-2D-1, and Q.GY.ui-6B) were consistently detected in more than three irrigated environments, called as stable QTL. Additionally, we identified 26 QTL clusters for more than two traits, of which the top four were located on Chromosomes 4A-1, 1B-1, 5B-2, and 2D-1. Overall, the stable QTL significantly related with grain yield, QTL clusters, and linked molecular markers identified in this study, may be useful in marker-assisted selection in early generation and early growth stage for grain yield improvement.

It is becoming feasible to use modern sensors and data analysis techniques for predicting plant growth and productivity based on genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data. To design and construct crops that deliver desired traits requires trained personnel with scientific and engineering expertise as well as a variety of \u201csoft\u201d skills. To address these needs at Iowa State University, we developed a graduate specialization called \u201cPredictive Plant Phenomics\u201d (P3). Although some of our experiences may be unique, many of the specialization\u2019s principles are likely to be broadly applicable to others interested in developing graduate training programs in plant phenomics. P3 involves transdisciplinary training and activities designed to develop communication, teambuilding, and management skills. To support students in this demanding and unique intellectual environment, we established a two-week boot camp before their first semester and founded a community of practice to support students throughout their graduate careers. Assessments show that P3 students understand the transdisciplinary training concepts, have formed a beneficial and supportive community, and interact with diverse faculty outside of their home departments.

Univariate analyses of traits were conducted on 95 plants from 2013 to 2017. The traits were: biomass yield per plant; C, N, and ash concentrations; leaf and culm sap sucrose concentrations; percentage seed set, and the number of caryopses per panicle. In 2013, the biomass yield averaged 0.21 \u00b1 0.09 kg per plant (mean \u00b1 the standard deviation). In 2014 to 2017, the yield averaged from 3.9 \u00b1 0.8 kg per plant to 7.5 \u00b1 1.8 kg per plant. Carbon concentration was generally higher than other energy crops, while N and ash concentrations were generally lower. Leaf sap sucrose ranged from 24.4 \u00b1 4.6 g kg\u22121 in 2016 to 41.6 \u00b1 7.6 g kg\u22121 in 2013.

Considerable progress in recent years has been made in agronomic and plant science research thanks to X-ray CT technology. X-ray CT image-based phenotyping methods enable high-throughput and non-destructive measuring and inference of root systems, which makes downstream studies of complex mechanisms of plants during growth feasible. An impressive amount of plant CT scanning data has been collected, but how to analyze these data efficiently and accurately remains a challenge. We review statistical and computational approaches that have been or may be effective for the analysis of 3D CT images of plant roots. We describe and comment on different approaches to aspects of the analysis of plant roots based on images, namely, (1) root segmentation, i.e., the isolation of root from non-root matter; (2) root-system reconstruction; and (3) extraction of higher-level phenotypes. As many of these approaches are novel and have yet to be applied to this context, we limit ourselves to brief descriptions of the methodologies. With the rapid development and growing use of X-ray CT scanning technologies to generate large volumes of data relevant to root structure, it is timely to review existing and potential quantitative and computational approaches to the analysis of such data. Summaries of several computational tools are included in the Appendix. View Full-Text", "Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important nutrients required for high productivity of the maize plant. In most farmers\u2019 fields in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is low availability of N in the soil mainly due to continuous cultivation of the land, crop residues removal, little or no application of fertilizers and rapid leaching. There is a need to develop low N tolerant and adapted maize genotypes. Evaluation of maize genotypes under different nitrogen conditions would therefore be useful in identifying genotypes that combine stability with high yield potential for both stress and non-stress environment. Eighty maize hybrids were evaluated at Mbalmayo and Nkolbisson in Cameroon, during 2012 and 2013 minor and major cropping seasons across 11 environments under low and high N conditions. The objectives of the study were: (i) to determine the effect of genotype x environment interaction (G \u00d7 E) on grain yield and yield stability of single cross maize hybrids across low N and optimum N environments and (ii) to identify genotypes to recommend for further use in the breeding program. Yield data of 80 hybrids were analyzed initially and the analysis of 20 best performing genotypes was further performed for a better visualization and interpretation of the results. Combined analysis of variance showed highly significant G \u00d7 E effects for grain yield. The GGE biplot analysis divided the study area into three mega environments: one related to the major cropping season while the two others were related to the minor cropping season. The grain yield of the 20 highest yielding hybrids ranged from 4484.7 to 5198.3 kg ha\u22121. Hybrid 1368 \u00d7 87036 was the highest yielding in the minor season while the most outstanding hybrid, TL-11-A-1642-5 \u00d7 87036 was the best for the major season. The latter hybrid showed the potential for production across environments and should therefore be further tested in multiple environments to confirm consistency of its high yield performance and stability, and to facilitate its release as a commercial hybrid. High yielding but not stable hybrids across environments could be recommended for the specific environments where they performed well.

Legumes play an important role in cropping systems, by associating with rhizobia microbes that convert plant-unavailable atmospheric nitrogen into usable nitrogen through symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). However, there can be field-level spatial variability for SNF activity, as well as underlying soil factors that influence SNF (e.g., macro/micronutrients, pH, and rhizobia). There is a need for PA tools that can diagnose spatial variability in SNF activity, as well as the relevant environmental factors that influence SNF. Little information is available in the literature concerning the potential of PA to diagnose/optimize SNF. Here, we critically analyze SNF/soil diagnostic methods that hold promise as PA tools in the short\u2013medium term. We also review the challenges facing additional diagnostics currently used for research, and describe the innovations needed to move them forward as PA tools. Our analysis suggests that the nitrogen difference method, isotope methods, and proximal and remote sensing techniques hold promise for diagnosing field-level variability in SNF. With respect to soil diagnostics, soil sensors and remote sensing techniques for nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, and salinity have short\u2013medium term potential to optimize legume SNF under field conditions.

One possibility is to exploit this type of information obtained from early stages of the growing season by combining it with genomic data. This opens an avenue that can be capitalized by improving the predictive ability of the common prediction models used for genomic prediction. Imagery (canopy coverage) data recorded between days 14\u201371 using two collection methods (ground information in 2013 and 2014; aerial information in 2014 and 2015) on a soybean nested association mapping population (SoyNAM) was used to calibrate the prediction models together with the inclusion of several types of interactions between canopy coverage data, environments, and genomic data. Three different scenarios were considered that breeders might face testing lines in fields: (i) incomplete field trials (CV2); (ii) newly developed lines (CV1); and (iii) predicting lines in unobserved environments (CV0). Two different traits were evaluated in this study: yield and days to maturity (DTM). Results showed improvements in the predictive ability for yield with respect to those models that solely included genomic data. These relative improvements ranged 27\u2013123%, 27\u2013148%, and 65\u2013165% for CV2, CV1, and CV0, respectively. No major changes were observed for DTM. Similar improvements were observed for both traits when the reduced canopy information for days 14\u201333 was used to build the training-testing relationships, showing a clear advantage of using phenomics in very early stages of the growing season.

Optimality criteria and a search algorithm were implemented to generate randomized complete block (RCB), incomplete block (IB), augmented block (AB) and unequally replicated (UR) designs. Several conditions were evaluated including size of the experiment, levels of heritability, and optimality criteria. For RCB designs with half-sib or full-sib families, the optimization procedure yielded important improvements under the presence of mild to strong spatial correlation levels and relatively low heritability values. Also, for these designs, improvements in terms of overall design efficiency (ODE%) reached values of up to 8.7%, but these gains varied depending on the evaluated conditions. In general, for all evaluated designs, higher ODE% values were achieved from genetically unrelated individuals compared to experiments with half-sib and full-sib families. As expected, accuracy of prediction of genetic values improved as levels of heritability and spatial correlations increased. This study has demonstrated that important improvements in design efficiency and prediction accuracies can be achieved by optimizing how the levels of a treatment are assigned to the experimental units.

This phenomenon minimizes the agronomic efficiency of N, P and K fertilizers and consequently result in a dwindling economic benefit associated with their use. Therefore, 18 on-farm trials were conducted in western Kenya during two cropping seasons to assess maize response to three NPK amendments; (i) N, P, K, Ca, Zn and Cu (inorganic and organic); (ii) N, P, K, Ca, Zn and Cu (inorganic) and (iii) N, P K, Zn and Cu (inorganic) and evaluate the profitability of their use compared to additions of only N, P and K fertilizers. In this set of experiments, maize response to any amendment refers to a yield increase of \u22652 t ha\u22121 above control and could be categorized in three clusters. Cluster 1, comprising of nine sites, maize responded to all amendments. Cluster 2, holding six sites, maize responded only to one amendment, N, P, K, Ca, Zn and Cu (inorganic). In this cluster, (2), emerging S, Mg and Cu deficiencies may still limit maize production. Cluster 3; consisting of three sites, maize responded poorly to all amendments due to relatively high soil fertility (\u226517 mg P kg\u22121). Profitability of using NPK amendments is limited to Cluster 1 and 2 and the largest Value Cost Ratio (VCR) of 3.1 is attainable only when soil available P is below 4.72 mg kg\u22121. These variable responses indicate the need for developing site-specific fertilizer recommendations for improved maize production and profitability of fertilizer use in poorly responsive soils.

Single-nucleotide and insertion\u2013deletion (InDel) polymorphisms have been widely used as DNA markers, not only in plant breeding but also to identify various traits in rice. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has produced sequences that allow for genome-wide detection of these molecular markers. These polymorphisms can potentially be used to develop high-accuracy polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers. PCR-based techniques are rapid and successful methods to deal with the problem of adulteration at a commercial level. Here, we report the genome-wide analysis of InDel markers of 17 commercially available Chinese cultivars. In order to achieve accurate results, all samples were sequenced at approximately 30\u00d7 genome coverage using Illumina HiSeq 2500\u2122 system. An average of 10.6 GB clean reads per sample was produced and ~96.3% of the reads could be mapped to the rice genome reference IRGSP 1.0. After a series of filtering, we selected five InDel markers for PCR validation. The results revealed that these InDel markers can be used for authentication of Korean elite cultivars from the adulterants.

Drought yield QTLs (qDTYs; QTLs = quantitative trait loci) were pyramided into MRQ74 and MR219 to produce drought tolerant lines. In this study, new drought tolerant MRQ74 and MR219 pyramided lines (PLs) were evaluated under drought stress (RS) and non-stress (NS) conditions to evaluate the effects of different qDTYs combinations on morphological and agronomical traits. MRQ74 PLs having qDTY12.1 possessed the best root length (RL) under both RS and NS but the effect was only significant for MR219 PLs under RS. Some qDTYs combinations also found to have consistent effect on the same trait of both populations. PLs with only qDTY12.1 showed the highest grain yield (GY) under RS in both populations which means qDTY12.1 controlled RL and caused higher GY under drought condition. The interaction of major-effect qDTY12.1 with qDTY2.2 also shows significant effect on leaf rolling (LR) of both PL populations. These qDTYs proved to be beneficial in improving traits related to drought tolerance. Selected PLs with qDTY12.1 combinations also found to have better RL and root weight (RW) under RS. Improvement of morphological and agronomical traits led to higher GY of PLs. Therefore, qDTY12.1 either is present singly or in combination with other qDTYs was the best qDTY due to its consistent effect on morphological and agronomical traits and GY across populations under RS and NS.

Therefore, an evaluation of irrigation water quality based on only a few crucial parameters, which consider the crop species to be irrigated and the type of irrigation system and management adopted, can be an easy and flexible method for maximizing the reuse of wastewater and low-quality water for agricultural purposes. In this view, an irrigation water quality tool (IWQT) was developed to support farmers of arid and semi-arid regions on evaluating the use of low quality water for crop irrigation. The most significant and cheapest parameters of irrigation water quality were identified and clustered in three quality classes according to their effects on crop yield and soil fertility (agronomic quality indicators), human health (hygiene and health quality indicators), and irrigation systems (management quality indicators). According to IWQT parameters, a tool reporting a series of recommendations, including water treatment types, was implemented to guide farmers on the use of low quality irrigation water.

The present paper reviews some of the most recent achievements in development of QPM varieties using both conventional and molecular breeding under stressed and non-stressed environments. It is evident that numerous QPM varieties have been developed and released around the world over the past few decades. While the review points out some gaps in information or research efforts, challenges associated with adoption QPM varieties are highlighted and suggestions to overcome them are presented. The adoption of released varieties and challenges facing QPM production at the farmer level are also mentioned. Several breeding methods have been conventionally used to develop QPM varieties in stressed (drought, low soil nitrogen, resistance to grey leaf spot, Turcicum leaf blight, ear rot, and Striga) and non-stressed environments. At least three genetic loci have been found to be implicated in controlling the levels of a protein synthesis factor correlated with lysine. They have been mapped on chromosomes 2, 4, and 7. While the use of molecular approaches will improve the efficiency and speed of variety development, the cost implications might limit the use of these technologies in the developing world. More emphasis should be given to breeding QPM for tolerance to environmental stresses, such as low soil pH, heat, and combined heat and drought stress. The post-harvest attack of QPM grains should also be considered. The adoption of QPM genotypes by farmers has been found to be limited mainly due to the minimal collaboration between maize breeders, farmers, agricultural extension workers, and other relevant stakeholders, as well as the need for isolating QPM varieties from normal maize. Therefore, there is need to use participatory plant breeding (PPB) and/or participatory variety selection (PVS) to enhance and improve the adoption of QPM varieties.

In addition, micronutrient application efficiency is fundamental to avoid periods of overconsumption or deficits in the crop. To determine micronutrient accumulation using a dynamic model, two cycles of Vitaly and Luxell cucumber crops were grown. During the development of the crop, micronutrient content (Fe, B, Mn, Cu, and Zn) in the different organs of the cucumber plant was quantified. The model dynamically simulated the accumulation of biomass and micronutrients using climatic variables recorded inside the greenhouse as inputs. It was found that a decrease in photosynthetically active radiation and temperature significantly diminished the accumulation of biomass by the cucumber plants. On the other hand, the results demonstrated that the model efficiently simulated both the accumulation of biomass and micronutrients in a cucumber crop. The efficiency evaluation showed values higher than R2 > 0.95. This dynamic model can be useful to define adequate strategies for the management of cucumber cultivation in greenhouses as well as the application of micronutrients.

Phosphorus is the second most limiting nutrient after nitrogen and has damaging impacts on crop yield if found to be deficient. Therefore, farmers tend to apply more P than is required to satisfy any P loss after its application at planting. Several important questions were raised in this study to improve P efficiency and reduce its pollution. The objective of this study was to find potential reasons for P pollution in water bodies despite a decrease in potato acreage. Historically, the potato was found to be responsible for P water contamination due to its high P sensitivity and low P removal (25\u201330 kg ha\u22121) from the soil. Despite University of Maine recommended rate of 56 kg ha\u22121 P, if soil tests reveal that P is below 50 kg ha\u22121, growers tend to apply P fertilizer at the rate of 182 kg ha\u22121 to compensate for any loss. The second key reason for excessive P application is its tendency to get fixed by aluminum (Al) in the soil. Soil sampling data from UMaine Soil Testing Laboratory confirmed that in Maine reactive Al levels have remained high over the last ten years and are increasing further. Likewise, P application to non-responsive sites, soil variability, pH change, and soil testing methods were found to be other possible reasons that might have led to increases in soil P levels resulting in P erosion to water streams.

Arsenic is present in different oxidative states in the environment and enters in the food chain through soil and water. In the agricultural field, irrigation with arsenic contaminated water, that is, having a higher level of arsenic contamination on the top soil, which may affects the quality of crop production. The major crop like rice (Oryza sativa L.) requires a considerable amount of water to complete its lifecycle. Rice plants potentially accumulate arsenic, particularly inorganic arsenic (iAs) from the field, in different body parts including grains. Different transporters have been reported in assisting the accumulation of arsenic in plant cells; for example, arsenate (AsV) is absorbed with the help of phosphate transporters, and arsenite (AsIII) through nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) by the silicon transport pathway and plasma membrane intrinsic protein aquaporins. Researchers and practitioners are trying their level best to mitigate the problem of As contamination in rice. However, the solution strategies vary considerably with various factors, such as cultural practices, soil, water, and environmental/economic conditions, etc. The contemporary work on rice to explain arsenic uptake, transport, and metabolism processes at rhizosphere, may help to formulate better plans. Common agronomical practices like rain water harvesting for crop irrigation, use of natural components that help in arsenic methylation, and biotechnological approaches may explore how to reduce arsenic uptake by food crops.

The development of A. toschiella-resistant wheat cultivars is a proven economically and ecologically viable method of controlling this pest. This study assessed A. toschiella resistance in wheat genotypes containing the H13, H21, H25, H26, H18 and Hdic genes for resistance to the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) and in 94M370 wheat, which contains the Dn7 gene for resistance to the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov). A. toschiella populations produced on plants containing Dn7 and H21 were significantly lower than those on plants of the susceptible control and no different than those on the resistant control. Dn7 resistance to D. noxia and H21 resistance to M. destructor resulted from translocations of chromatin from rye into wheat (H21\u20142BS/2RL, Dn7\u20141BL/1RS). These results provide new wheat pest management information, indicating that Dn7 and H21 constitute resources that can be used to reduce yield losses caused by A. toschiella, M. destructor, D. noxia, and wheat streak mosaic virus infection by transferring multi-pest resistance to single sources of germplasm.

Given that NUEagron (grain yield/total N uptake) is a function of harvest index (HI; grain yield/crop biomass) \u00d7 crop biomass/total N uptake, and that improving HI is already the target of most breeding programs, and specific improvement in NUEagron can only really be achieved by increasing the crop biomass/N uptake. Since rice crops take up around 80% of total crop N prior to flowering, improving the biomass/N uptake (NUEveg) prior to, or at, flowering may be the best means to improve the NUEagron. Ultimately, however, enhanced NUEagron may come at the expense of grain protein unless the N harvest index increases concurrently. We investigated the relationships between NUEagron, total N uptake, grain yield, grain N concentration (i.e., protein) and N harvest index (NHI) in 16 rice genotypes under optimal N conditions over two seasons to determine if scope exists to improve the NHI and/or grain protein, while maintaining or enhancing NUEagron in rice. Using data from these experiments and from an additional experiment with cv. IR64 under optimum conditions at an experimental farm to establish a benchmark for NUE parameters in high-input, high yielding conditions, we simulated theoretical potential improvements in NUEveg that could be achieved in both low and high-input scenarios by manipulating target NHIs and grain protein levels. Simulations suggested that scope exists to increase grain protein levels in low yielding scenarios with only modest (5\u201310%) reductions in current NUEagron by increasing the current NHI from 0.6 to 0.8. Furthermore, substantial scope exists to improve NUEveg (and therefore NUEagron) in high-yielding scenarios if maintaining current grain protein levels of 7.3% is not essential.

For an objective comparison between different crops, a common framework is required to assess their economic or energetic performance. In this paper, a computational tool for the energy cost evaluation of multiple-crop production systems is presented. All the in-field and transport operations are considered, providing a detailed analysis of the energy requirements of the components that contribute to the overall energy consumption. A demonstration scenario is also described. The scenario is based on three selected energy crops, namely Miscanthus, Arundo donax and Switchgrass. The tool can be used as a decision support system for the evaluation of different agronomical practices (such as fertilization and agrochemicals application), machinery systems, and management practices that can be applied in each one of the individual crops within the production system.

Crop Surface Models (CSMs) representing the absolute height of the plant canopy are a tool for this. In this study, fresh and dry barley biomass per plot are estimated from CSM-derived plot-wise plant heights. The CSMs are generated in a semi-automated manner using Structure-from-Motion (SfM)/Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) software from oblique stereo RGB images. The images were acquired automatedly from consumer grade smart cameras mounted at an elevated position on a lifting hoist. Fresh and dry biomass were measured destructively at four dates each in 2014 and 2015. We used exponential and simple linear regression based on different calibration/validation splits. Coefficients of determination between 0.55 and 0.79 and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 97 and 234 g/m2 are reached for the validation of predicted vs. observed dry biomass, while Willmott\u2019s refined index of model performance ranges between 0.59 and 0.77. For fresh biomass, values between 0.34 and 0.61 are reached, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 312 and 785 g/m2 and between 0.39 and 0.66. We therefore established the possibility of using this novel low-cost system to estimate barley dry biomass over time.

Likewise, in widely used heuristic frameworks, such as the social\u2013ecological system (SES) framework, governance interactions between resources are not sufficiently addressed. We address this gap empirically, using the case of Tajikistan, based on a farm household survey analysis of 306 farmers. The results indicate that land system variables contribute to the willingness to cooperate in irrigation management. Specifically, formal land tenure has a positive effect on farmers paying for water as well as on the likelihood of their investing time and effort in irrigation infrastructure, which is decisive for Tajikistan\u2019s food and fiber production. Irrigation system variables show that, e.g., being an upstream user increases the likelihood to contribute to labor maintenance efforts. We further discuss how decisions with respect to the land sector could be designed in the future to facilitate cooperation in other resource sectors. Further, we conclude from a conceptual perspective that the SES framework integrating a nexus perspective can be adapted: either (1) by adding a second-tier \u201cgovernance nexus\u201d variable inside the governance variable of an irrigation system; or (2) by adding a land resource unit and system outside the irrigation system.

Some authors report such estimates as one of the outcome variables of experiment station studies, while others calculate water productivities when comparing regional crop production information. Many authors suggest or imply that higher values of water productivity are needed to ensure that future food production goals are achieved. Yet maximizing water productivity might not be consistent with farm-level goals or with societal objectives regarding water allocation and management. Farmers in both rainfed and irrigated settings must address a complex set of issues pertaining to risk, uncertainty, prices, and opportunity costs, when selecting activities and determining optimal strategies. It is not clear that farmers in either setting will or should choose to maximize water productivity. Upon examining water productivity, both conceptually and empirically, using published versions of crop production functions, I conclude that estimates of water productivity contain too little information to enhance understanding of farm-level water management.

However, yield stability is a relevant factor in agronomic practice and, therefore, is the focus of this comprehensive survey. The aim was to first describe the importance of yield stability as well as currently used practical management strategies that ensure yield stability in wheat production and secondly, to obtain potential research areas supporting yield stability in the complex system of agronomy. The target groups were German farmers with experience in wheat production and advisors with expertise in the field of wheat cultivation or research. A sample size of 615 completed questionnaires formed the data basis of this study. The study itself provides evidence that the yield stability of winter wheat is even more important than the amount of yield for a large proportion of farmers (48%) and advisors (47%). Furthermore, in the view of the majority of the surveyed farmers and advisors, yield stability is gaining importance in climate change. Data analysis showed that site adapted cultivar choice, favorable crop rotations and integrated plant protection are ranked as three of the most important agronomic management practices to achieve high yield stability of wheat. Soil tillage and fertilization occupied a middle position, whereas sowing date and sowing density were estimated with lower importance. However, yield stability is affected by many environmental, genetic and agronomic factors, which subsequently makes it a complex matter. Hence, yield stability in farming practice must be analyzed and improved in a systems approach.

In some cases, excessive fertilizers or side-dressings are applied when circumstances are not favorable for uptake. Aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems are sensitive to enrichment with nutrients, but growers also benefit when losses are avoided. In this study, the potential of proximal optical sensors to optimize nitrogen fertilization was investigated in four woody species: Acer pseudoplatanus L., Ligustrum ovalifolium Hassk., Prunus laurocerasus \u2018Rotundifolia\u2019 L. and Tilia cordata Mill. For three consecutive growing seasons, plants were grown under three different fertilization levels to generate different nitrogen contents. Plant growth and nitrogen uptake were monitored regularly and combined with sensor measurements including Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD), Dualex and GreenSeeker. Here, we show that optical sensors at the leaf level have good potential for assisting growers in the sustainable management of their nursery fields, especially if leaf mass per area is included. Nevertheless, care should be taken when plants with different leaf characteristics (e.g., wax-layer, color, and leaf thickness) are measured. When all measuring years were considered, high correlations (R2 \u2265 0.80) were found between area-based foliar nitrogen content and its non-destructive proxy (i.e., chlorophyll)measured by Dualex or SPAD. Based on our results, we recommend a relative rather than absolute approach at the nursery level, as the number of species and cultivars produced is very diverse. Hence, knowledge of absolute threshold values is scarce. In this relative approach, a saturation index was calculated based on the sensor measurements of plants grown in a reference plot with an ample nitrogen supply.

A new generation of crops that yield more with fewer inputs and are adapted to more variable environments is needed. However, major changes in breeding programmes may be required to achieve this goal. By using the genetic variation in crop yield in specific target environments that vary in soil type, soil management, nutrient inputs and environmental stresses, robust traits suited to specific conditions can be identified. It is here that long-term experimental platforms and field phenotyping have an important role to play. In this review, we will provide information about some of the field-based platforms available and the cutting edge phenotyping systems at our disposal. We will also identify gaps in our field phenotyping resources that should be filled. We will go on to review the challenges in producing crop ideotypes for the dominant management systems for which we need sustainable solutions, and we discuss the potential impact of three-way interactions between genetics, environment and management. Finally, we will discuss the role that modelling can play in allowing us to fast-track some of these processes to allow us to make rapid gains in agricultural sustainability.

Water content, water activity and color of 50 declared acacia samples, collected from three different geographical zones of Romania, together with chromatographic determination of sugar spectrum were analyzed. A number of 79 volatile compounds from the classes of: Alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, sulphur compounds, aliphatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen compounds, carboxylic acids, aromatic acids and ethers were identified by solid-phase micro-extraction and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry. The overall volatile profile and sugar spectrum of the investigated honey samples allow the differentiation of geographical origin for the acacia honey samples subjected to analysis. The statistical models of the chromatic determination, physicochemical parameters and volatile profile was optimal to characterize the honey samples and group them into three geographical origins, even they belong to the same botanical origin.

Nanofertilizers are a promising application of nanotechnology in agriculture. The use of nanofertilizers in an efficient and safe manner calls for knowledge about the actual effects of nanoproducts on the plant metabolism and eventually on the carrier release kinetics and nutrient accumulation. Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) nanoparticles (nHA) have an interesting potential to be used as nanofertilizers. In this study, the effects of different nHA solutions stabilized with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were evaluated on germination, seedling growth, and metabolism of Solanum lycopersicum L., used as model species. Our observations showed that the percentage germination of S. lycopersicum is not influenced by increasing concentrations of nHa, while root elongation is strongly stimulated. Tomato plants grown in hydroponics in the presence of nHA have not suffered phytotoxic effects. We conclude that nHA had nontoxic effects on our model plant and therefore it could be used both as a P supplier and carrier of other elements and molecules.

Recent advances in e-nose technologies within the plant sciences, including improvements in gas-sensor designs, innovations in data analysis and pattern-recognition algorithms, and progress in material science and systems integration methods, have led to significant benefits to both industries. Electronic noses have been used in a variety of commercial agricultural-related industries, including the agricultural sectors of agronomy, biochemical processing, botany, cell culture, plant cultivar selections, environmental monitoring, horticulture, pesticide detection, plant physiology and pathology. Applications in forestry include uses in chemotaxonomy, log tracking, wood and paper processing, forest management, forest health protection, and waste management. These aroma-detection applications have improved plant-based product attributes, quality, uniformity, and consistency in ways that have increased the efficiency and effectiveness of production and manufacturing processes.

However, some necrotrophic pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea, actively induce the SA pathway, resulting in cell death that allows the pathogen to proliferate in the plant. Starting from an isogenic canola (Brassica napus) line, epilines were selected with a reduced sensitivity to SA. The genes belonging to the SA pathway had an altered transcription profile in the SA-tolerant lines, when treated with SA. Besides the already known genes of the SA pathway, new SA target genes were identified, creating possibilities to better understand the plant defense mechanism against pathogens. The SA-tolerant line with the lowest SA-induced gene expression is tolerant to Botrytis cinerea. When treated with SA, this line has also a reduced histone modification (histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation) at the genes at the start of the SA pathway.

Among the various VOCs, methyl propanoate (MP) and methyl prop-2-enoate (MA) exhibited remarkable antifungal effects under different experimental conditions (direct or indirect contact) and at different concentrations (500\u20131000 \u03bcM). In addition, the type of antifungal effect (fungistatic or fungicidal) appeared to be strongly correlated with the VOC concentrations. Additional tests revealed that both molecules increased membrane permeability of pathogenic spores, which resulted in a decreased efflux of K+ ions into the intracellular medium.

The increase in concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), not only affects plant growth and development, but also affects the emission of plant organic volatile compounds (VOCs). Changes in the plant odor profile may affect the plant-insect interactions, especially the behavior of herbivorous insects. In this study, we compared the foraging behavior of corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings grown under contrasted CO2 concentrations. During the dual choice bioassays, the winged and wingless aphids were more attracted by the VOCs of barley seedlings cultivated under ambient CO2 concentrations (aCO2; 450 ppm) than barley seedlings cultivated under elevated CO2 concentrations (eCO2; 800 ppm), nymphs were not attracted by the VOCs of eCO2 barley seedlings. Then, volatile compositions from 14-d-old aCO2 and eCO2 barley seedlings were investigated by GC-MS. While 16 VOCs were identified from aCO2 barley seedlings, only 9 VOCs were found from eCO2 barley seedlings. At last, we discussed the potential role of these chemicals observed during choice bioassays. Our findings lay foundation for functional response of corn leaf aphid under climate change through host plant modifications.

Although roughly 60% of the continent\u2019s population is engaged in agriculture, the produce from this sector cannot feed its citizens. Hence, in 2013 alone, Africa imported 56.5 million tons of wheat, maize, and soybean at the cost of 18.8 billion USD. Although crops cultivated in Africa play a vital role in their contribution to Food Security, they produce inferior yields compared to those in other parts of the world. For instance, the average cereal yield in Africa is only 1.6 t\u00b7ha\u22121 compared to the global 3.9 t\u00b7ha\u22121. Low productivity in Africa is also related to poor soil fertility and scarce moisture, as well as a variety of insect pests, diseases, and weeds. While moisture scarcity is responsible for up to 60% of yield losses in some African staple cereals, insect pests inflict annually substantial crop losses. In order to devise a strategy towards boosting crop productivity on the continent where food insecurity is most prevalent, these production constraints should be investigated and properly addressed. This review focuses on conventional (also known as genetic) intensification in which crop productivity is raised through breeding for cultivars with high yield-potential and those that thrive well under diverse and extreme environmental conditions. Improved crop varieties alone do not boost crop productivity unless supplemented with optimum soil, water, and plant management practices as well as the promotion of policies pertaining to inputs, credit, extension, and marketing. Studies in Kenya and Uganda have shown that the yield of cassava can be increased by 140% in farmers\u2019 fields using improved varieties and management practices. In addition to traditional organic and inorganic fertilizers, biochar and African Dark Earths have been found to improve soil properties and to enhance productivity, although their availability and affordability to African farmers remains to be explored. The concept of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) has been successfully implemented in some African countries in the Great Lake Region. Other innovative technologies favorably accepted by farmers are the \u201cPush-pull System\u201d (an elegant method of controlling a devastating insect pest and a parasitic weed) and NERICA (New Rice for Africa, in which rice varieties with desirable nutritional and agronomic properties were developed by crossing Asian and African rice). This review calls for African governments and institutions not only to provide conducive environments but also to abide by the Maputo 2003 Declaration where they agreed to invest 10% of their national budget to agricultural research and development as the outcome has a positive impact on productivity and ultimately improves the livelihood of farmers.

Vietnam is known as an emerging market, which depends directly on agriculture-related activities for their livelihood, in which the issue of rural credit access still remains a confounding problem. The paper focuses on the characteristics of rural credit markets, the determinants of farmer access to the markets, the socio-economic impacts of credit access in Vietnam and briefly comparing with those of some developing countries. This question is addressed by reviewing existing literature and empirical evidence, followed by a comprehensive case study in Vietnam. Comprehensive literature review with secondary data collection and key informant interviews are methods that are applied in this research. The results of this analysis indicate the features of Vietnam markets as participated constraints, government intervention, and segmentation. Other results reveal the significant determinants of credit accessibility. Impacts of credit access on output production, household income, and poverty reduction are highlighted in this paper. Some managerial implications are recommended for households through participation in lending networks; for financial institutions relating to expand target clients as well as capital allocation; and, for policy-makers via ensuring market competitiveness and sustainable development in the long run.

Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are interesting versatile tools that can provide relevant 3D information, such as sward height (3D structure), or even describe the physical condition of pastures through the use of spectral information. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of UAS to characterize a pasture\u2019s sward height and above-ground biomass at a very fine spatial scale. The pasture height provided by UAS products showed good agreement (R2 = 0.62) with a reference terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) dataset. We tested the ability of UAS imagery to model pasture biomass based on three different combinations: UAS sward height, UAS sward multispectral reflectance/vegetation indices, and a combination of both UAS data types. The mixed approach combining the UAS sward height and spectral data performed the best (adj. R2 = 0.49). This approach reached a quality comparable to that of more conventional non-destructive on-field pasture biomass monitoring tools. As all of the UAS variables used in the model fitting process were extracted from spatial information (raster data), a high spatial resolution map of pasture biomass was derived based on the best fitted model. A sward height differences map was also derived from UAS-based sward height maps before and after grazing. Our results demonstrate the potential of UAS imagery as a tool for precision grazing study applications. The UAS approach to height and biomass monitoring was revealed to be a potential alternative to the widely used but time-consuming field approaches. While reaching a similar level of accuracy to the conventional field sampling approach, the UAS approach provides wall-to-wall pasture characterization through very high spatial resolution maps, opening up a new area of research for precision grazing.

The effect of these amendments on plant growth may depend on physicochemical soil parameters, in particular pH. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of soil pH on biomass production, P use efficiency, and soil P forms after P amendment application (100 mg kg\u22121 P) using poultry manure compost (PM), rock phosphate (RP), and their combination (PMRP). We performed a growth chamber experiment with ryegrass plants (Lolium perenne) grown on two soil types with contrasting pH under controlled conditions for 7 weeks. Chemical P fractions, biomass production, and P concentrations were measured to calculate plant uptake and P use efficiency. We found a strong synergistic effect on the available soil P, while antagonistic effects were observed for ryegrass production and P uptake. We conclude that although the combination of PM and RP has positive effects in terms of soil P availability, the combined effects of the mixture must be taken into account and further evaluated for different soil types and grassland plants to maximize synergistic effects and to minimize antagonistic ones.

The use of remote sensing can substantially support traditional field inventories to evaluate and characterize this resource. Existing studies have already realized the automated detection of trees outside the forest (TOF) and classified the subsequently mapped TOF into three geometrical classes: single objects, linear objects, and ample objects. This study goes further by presenting a fully automated classification method that can support the operational management of TOF as it separates TOF into seven classes matching the definitions used in field inventories: Isolated tree, Aligned trees, Agglomerated trees, Hedge, Grove, Shrub, and Other. Using publicly available software tools, an orthophoto, and a LIDAR canopy height model (CHM), a TOF map was produced and a two-step method was developed for the classification of TOF: (1) the geometrical classification of each TOF polygon; and (2) the spatial neighboring analysis of elements and their classification into seven classes. The overall classification accuracy was 78%. Our results highlight that an automated TOF classification is possible with classes matching the definitions used in field inventories. This suggests that remote sensing has a huge potential to support the operational management of TOF as well as other research areas regarding TOF.

The aim of this work is the characterization of a new variety of red escarole obtained after a long-term breeding program involving the interspecies crossing between red radicchio and green escarole. Our multidisciplinary approach of investigation allowed us to study the effects of the crossing on several aspects, including the accumulation of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, the expression pattern of some of the key genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, and the sensory profiling of the new variety obtained. Given the results, it is possible to conclude that the new variety of red escarole presents traits deriving from both radicchio and escarole.

This study provides an approach for modeling the joint impact of inorganic N and P fertilization on crop production, considering the P supplied by the soil, which was approximated using the soil test P (STP). We developed yield response models for Finnish spring barley crops (Hordeum vulgare L.) for clay and coarse-textured soils by using existing extensive experimental datasets and nonlinear estimation techniques. Model selection was based on iterative elimination from a wide diversity of plausible model formulations. The Cobb\u2212Douglas type model specification, consisting of multiplicative elements, performed well against independent validation data, suggesting that the key relationships that determine crop responses are captured by the models. The estimated models were extended to dynamic economic optimization of fertilization inputs. According to the results, a fair STP level should be maintained on both coarse-textured soils (9.9 mg L\u22121 a\u22121) and clay soils (3.9 mg L\u22121 a\u22121). For coarse soils, a higher steady-state P fertilization rate is required (21.7 kg ha\u22121 a\u22121) compared with clay soils (6.75 kg ha\u22121 a\u22121). The steady-state N fertilization rate was slightly higher for clay soils (102.4 kg ha\u22121 a\u22121) than for coarse soils (95.8 kg ha\u22121 a\u22121).

In the laboratory experiment, the Unikum genotype showed the highest seed germination (95.1%), whereas the lowest was found for Kinelskoje (80.4%). Regardless of the osmoticum type, germination was significantly reduced by osmotic pressure increases. Unikum showed a higher fresh biomass yield (FBY) (620.4 \u00b1 126.3 g m\u22122) than Kinelskoje (340.0 \u00b1 73.5 g m\u22122). AMF inoculation did not influence FBY under salt conditions, while in the absence of salt conditions it significantly increased the Unikum FBY (+50.7%) as compared to the uninoculated treatment (552.5 \u00b1 269 g m\u22122). The 25% ETm significantly reduced FBY in both genotypes (\u221286.2% and \u221284.1% for Unikum and Kinelskoje, respectively) sd compared to the 100% ETm treatments (1090.3 \u00b1 49.7 g m\u22122 in Unikum and 587 \u00b1 72.2 g m\u22122 in Kinelskoje).

On a large scale, LAI can be estimated with the help of imaging spectroscopy. However, recent studies have revealed that the leaf angle greatly affects the spectral reflectance of the canopy and hence imaging spectroscopy data. To investigate the effects of the leaf angle on LAI-sensitive narrowband vegetation indices, we used both empirical measurements from field crops and model-simulated data generated by the PROSAIL canopy reflectance model. We found the relationship between vegetation indices and LAI to be notably affected, especially when the leaf mean tilt angle (MTA) exceeded 70 degrees. Of the indices used in the study, the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) was most strongly affected by leaf angles, while the blue normalized difference vegetation index (BNDVI), the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), the modified simple ratio using the wavelength of 705 nm (MSR705), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were only affected for sparse canopies (LAI < 3) and MTA exceeding 60\u00b0. Generally, the effect of MTA on the vegetation indices increased as a function of decreasing LAI. The leaf chlorophyll content did not affect the relationship between BNDVI, MSAVI, NDVI, and LAI, while the green atmospherically resistant index (GARI), GNDVI, and MSR705 were the most strongly affected indices. While the relationship between SR and LAI was somewhat affected by both MTA and the leaf chlorophyll content, the simple ratio (SR) displayed only slight saturation with LAI, regardless of MTA and the chlorophyll content. The best index found in the study for LAI estimation was BNDVI, although it performed robustly only for LAI > 3 and showed considerable nonlinearity. Thus, none of the studied indices were well suited for across-species LAI estimation: information on the leaf angle would be required for remote LAI measurement, especially at low LAI values. Nevertheless, narrowband indices can be used to monitor the LAI of crops with a constant leaf angle distribution. View Full-Text", "Crop growth in different periods influences the final yield. This study started from the agronomic mechanism of yield formation and aimed to extract useful spectral characteristics in different phenological phases, which could directly describe the final yield and dynamic contributions of different phases to the yield formation. Hyperspectral information of the winter wheat canopy was acquired during three important phases (jointing stage, heading stage, and grain-filling stage). An enhanced 2D correlation spectral analysis method modified by mutual information was proposed to identify the sensitive wavebands. The selected wavebands performed well with good mechanism interpretation and close correlation with important crop growth parameters and main physiological activities related to yield formation. The quantitative contribution proportions of plant growth in three phases to the final yield were estimated by determining the coefficients of partial least square models based on full spectral information. They were then used as single-phase weight factors to merge the selected wavebands. The support vector machine model based on the weighted spectral dataset performed well in yield prediction with satisfactory accuracy and robustness. This result would provide rapid and accurate guidance for agricultural production and would be valuable for the processing of hyperspectral remote sensing data.

Eighteen (18) commercial formulations were identified, with more than 50% of pesticides destined for cotton production. Eleven active substances have been identified and the most frequently used are \u03bb-cyhalothrin (35%), acetamiprid (22%) and profenofos (13%). The most commonly used chemical families are pyrethroids (28%) and organophosphates (18%). The study revealed a low level of training for producers, a high use of pesticides according to the Frequency Treatment Indicator, and a very low level of protection used by producers. The Health Risk Index shows that active substances such as methomyl, \u03bb-cyhalothrin and profenofos present very high risk to operators\u2019 health. Based on the UK-POEM model, the predictive exposure levels obtained varied from 0.0105 mg/kg body weight/day to 1.7855 mg/kg body weight/day, which is several times higher than the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level. However, the study also shows that exposure can be greatly reduced if the required Personal Protective Equipment is worn.

The composition of ground vegetation on pastures determines the value of both the forage for grazing animals as well as the biodiversity values for species associated with the pastoral ecosystems. We studied three pastures, each representing one of the management types in southern Finland (latitudes 60\u201361): semi-natural, permanent and cultivated grassland. All have been grazed exclusively by horses for several decades. We aimed to evaluate feeding values and horses\u2019 welfare, on the one hand, and impacts of horses on biodiversity in boreal conditions, on the other. Though there were differences among the pastures, the nutritional value of the vegetation in all three pastures met the energy and protein needs of most horse categories through the whole grazing season. Some mineral concentrations were low compared to the requirements, and supplementation of Cu, Zn and Na is needed to balance the mineral intake. Only minor injuries or health problems were observed. All metrics of biological values, as well as number of species eaten by horses, were particularly high in a semi-natural pasture compared to other pasture types. The highest ratio of species cover preferred by horses to the total cover was found in the permanent pasture, while at the regularly re-seeded pasture, there was a particularly high cover of species, indicating low biodiversity values on grassland. There was, therefore, a trade-off between the quantity of forage and biological values in pastures, but not in quality. The results provide clear indication both for the suitability of the studied pasture types to horses and for grazing of horses for biodiversity management. In each pasture type, specific management is needed to simultaneously achieve objectives of adequate pasturing and biodiversity. The short duration (only one grazing season) must be considered when applying the results.

CLCuD is caused by monopartite plant viruses belonging to the family Geminiviridae (genus Begomovirus), in association with an essential, disease-specific satellite, Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) belonging to a newly-established family Tolecusatellitidae (genus Betasatellite). CLCuMuB has a small genome (ca. 1350 nt) with a satellite conserved region, an adenine-rich region and a single gene that encodes for a multifunctional \u03b2C1 protein. CLCuMuB \u03b2C1 protein has a major role in pathogenicity and symptom determination, and alters several host cellular functions like autophagy, ubiquitination, and suppression of gene silencing, to assist CLCuD infectivity. Efficient trans-replication ability of CLCuMuB with several monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses, is also associated with the rapid evolution and spread of CLCuMuB. In this article we comprehensively reviewed the role of CLCuMuB in CLCuD, focusing on the \u03b2C1 functions and its interactions with host proteins.

The bouquets were collected from 50 florists located in the seven largest cities of Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Ghent, Leuven, Liege, and Namur) and from five supermarkets located in the different regions. To have a better understanding of the route of exposure and professional practices a questionnaire was also addressed to a group of 25 florists who volunteered to take part in the survey. All florists were interviewed individually when collecting the questionnaire. The residual pesticide deposit values on cut flowers were determined in an accredited laboratory using a multi-residue (QuEChERS Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe) method and a combination of gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chormatograhphy (LC) analysis. A total of 107 active substances were detected from all samples; i.e., an average of about 10 active substances per bouquet. The most severely contaminated bouquet accumulated a total concentration of residues up to 97 mg/kg. Results show that roses are the most contaminated cut flowers; with an average of 14 substances detected per sample and a total concentration per rose sample of 26 mg/kg. Some active substances present an acute toxicity (acephate, methiocarb, monocrotophos, methomyl, deltamethrin, etc.) and exposure can generate a direct effect on the nervous system of florists. Nevertheless, fungicides (dodemorph, propamocarb, and procymidone) were the most frequently detected in samples and had the highest maximum concentrations out of all the active substances analysed. Dodemorph was the most frequently detected substance with the highest maximum concentration (41.9 mg/kg) measured in the rose samples. It appears from the survey that, despite being exposed to high deposits of residues, florists usually do not protect themselves from contact with residues even if they spend several hours handling cut flowers and preparing bouquets (from 2 to 6 h/day, depending on the time of year and/or selling periods) daily. Bad habits (eating, drinking, or smoking at work) and absence of personal protective equipment of most florists also increase the risk of contact with pesticide residues.

Some of its roles include the participation in the antioxidant defense the cattle farms. The nutritional requirements of Se in cattle are estimated at 100 \u03bcg/kg DM (dry matter) for beef cattle and at 300 \u03bcg/kg DM for dairy cows. The rations high in fermentable carbohydrates, nitrates, sulfates, calcium or hydrogen cyanide negatively influence the organism\u2019s use of the selenium contained in the diet. The Se supplementation may reduce the incidence of metritis and ovarian cysts during the postpartum period. The increase in fertility when adding Se is attributed to the reduction of the embryonic death during the first month of gestation. A use of organic Se in feed would provide a better transfer of Se in calves relative to mineral Se supplementation. The addition of Se yeasts in the foodstuffs of cows significantly increases the Se content and the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in milk compared to the addition of sodium selenite. The enzyme 5-iodothyronine deiodinase is a seleno-dependent selenoprotein. It is one of the last proteins to be affected in the event of Se deficiency. This delay in response could explain the fact that several studies did not show the effect of Se supplementation on growth and weight gain of calves. Enrichment of Se in the diet did not significantly affect the slaughter weight and carcass yield of bulls. The impact and results of Se supplementation in cattle depend on physiological stage, Se status of animals, type and content of Se and types of Se administration. Further studies in Se supplementation should investigate the speciation of Se in food and yeasts, as well as understanding their metabolism and absorption. This constitute a path to exploit in order to explain certain different effects of Se. View Full-Text", "Knowledge on sustainable grassland management is available in the large body of literature. However, it is unclear where to look for it, and what is really relevant to the many interrelated challenges of sustainable grassland management. This special issue illustrates options to fill some of those gaps. This editorial introduces the Special Issue entitled \u201cGrassland Management for Sustainable Agroecosystems\u201d.

An effective method to enhance phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) and its availability to plants is the application of alginate bioaugmented coated di-ammonium phosphate (DAP). In this study, the pre-isolated P solubilizing Paraburkholderia phytofirmans (PsJN) coated with different concentrations of polymer (alginate) on DAP with and without carbon source was tested in incubation, pot, and field experiments to investigate microbial survival, Olsen P release, and its availability to plants. Results indicated that the maximum recovery of PsJN loaded on alginate at 30 days incubation with and without carbon source was 199 \u00d7 1010 and 82 \u00d7 106 CFU mL\u22121 respectively. Application of alginate bioaugmented DAP released 962 mg kg\u22121 Olsen P after 60 days of incubation compared to 280 and 370 mg kg\u22121 Olsen P released by uncoated and simple alginate coated DAP, respectively. Results from pot trial revealed that application of 100% alginate bioaugmented DAP increased 26% plant height, 31% photosynthetic rate, 55% grain yield, and 6 \u00d7 105 CFU g\u22121 root bacterial population, compared to uncoated DAP. Field trial results indicated that 22% grain yield, 14% straw yield, and 44% agronomy P efficiency were increased by applying 100% alginate bioaugmented DAP compared to uncoated DAP. This new approach resulted in controlled release of P from coated DAP that not only reduced phosphorus fixation but also enhanced the bioavailability of P to plants.

Aquaponics, as a closed loop system consisting of hydroponics and aquaculture elements, could contribute to addressing these problems. However, there is a lack of quantitative research to support the development of economically feasible aquaponics systems. Although many studies have addressed some scientific aspects, there has been limited focus on commercial implementation. In this review paper, opportunities that have the potential to fill the gap between research and implementation of commercial aquaponic systems have been identified. The analysis shows that aquaponics is capable of being an important driver for the development of integrated food production systems. Arid regions suffering from water stress will particularly benefit from this technology being operated in a commercial environment.

Ethylene induces many functions in latex cells including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of ROS is responsible for the coagulation of rubber particles in latex cells, resulting in the partial or complete stoppage of latex flow. This study set out to assess biochemical and histological changes as well as changes in gene expression in latex and phloem tissues from trees grown under various harvesting systems. The Tapping Panel Dryness (TPD) susceptibility of Hevea clones was found to be related to some biochemical parameters, such as low sucrose and high inorganic phosphorus contents. A high tapping frequency and ethephon stimulation induced early TPD occurrence in a high latex metabolism clone and late occurrence in a low latex metabolism clone. TPD-affected trees had smaller number of laticifer vessels compared to healthy trees, suggesting a modification of cambial activity. The differential transcript abundance was observed for twenty-seven candidate genes related to TPD occurrence in latex and phloem tissues for ROS-scavenging, ethylene biosynthesis and signalling genes. The predicted function for some Ethylene Response Factor genes suggested that these candidate genes should play an important role in regulating susceptibility to TPD.

Currently, growers in Illinois and other neighboring states in the U.S. Midwest use the maximum return to N (MRTN) decision support system to predict corn N requirements. However, the current tool does not factor in implications of integrating cover crops into the rotation, which has recently gained attention among growers due to several ecosystem services associated with cover cropping. A two-year field trail was conducted at the Agronomy Research Center in Carbondale, IL in 2018 and 2019 to evaluate whether split N application affects nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of corn with and without a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crop. A randomized complete block design with split plot arrangements and four replicates was used. Main plots were cover crop treatments (no cover crop (control) compared to a wheat cover crop) and subplots were N timing applications to the corn: (1) 168 kg N ha\u22121 at planting; (2) 56 kg N ha\u22121 at planting + 112 kg N ha\u22121 at sidedress; (3) 112 kg N ha\u22121 at planting + 56 kg N ha\u22121 at sidedress; and (4) 168 kg N ha\u22121 at sidedress along with a zero-N control as check plot. Corn yield was higher in 2018 than 2019 reflecting more timely precipitation in that year. In 2018, grain yield declined by 12.6% following the wheat cover crop compared to no cover crop control, indicating a yield penalty when corn was preceded with a wheat cover crop. In 2018, a year with timely and sufficient rainfall, there were no yield differences among N treatments and N balances were near zero. In 2019, delaying the N application improved NUE and corn grain yield due to excessive rainfall early in the season reflecting on N losses which was confirmed by lower N balances in sidedressed treatments. Overall, our findings suggest including N credit for cereals in MRTN prediction model could help with improved N management in the Midwestern United States.

Bioenergy crops provide one means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy production and two novel crops that could be used for this purpose are Sida hermaphrodita (L.) Rusby and Silphium perfoliatum L. This research examined the existing scientific literature available on both crops through a systematic review. The data were collated according to the agronomy, uses, and environmental benefits of each crop. Possible challenges were associated with high initial planting costs, low yields in low rainfall areas, and for Sida hermaphrodita, vulnerability to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. However, under appropriate environmental conditions, both crops were found to provide large yields over sustained periods of time with relatively low levels of management and could be used to produce large energy surpluses, either through direct combustion or biogas production. Other potential uses included fodder, fibre, and pharmaceutical uses. Environmental benefits included the potential for phytoremediation, and improvements to soil health, biodiversity, and pollination. The review also demonstrated that environmental benefits, such as pollination, soil health, and water quality benefits could be obtained from the use of Sida hermaphrodita and Silphium perfoliatum relative to existing bioenergy crops such as maize, whilst at the same time reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy production. Future research should examine the long-term implications of using Sida hermaphrodita and Silphium perfoliatum as well as improve knowledge on how to integrate them successfully within existing farming systems and supply chains.

As wheat is the most important crop in Poland, with a total of about 22% of the total sown area, the study of its performance in environments with different productivity levels for consequent cultivar recommendation is of major importance. In this paper, we assess the relative performance of winter wheat cultivars in environments with different productivity and propose a method for cultivar recommendation, by considering the information of environmental conditions and drought stress. This is performed in the following steps: (1) calculation of expected wheat productivity, depending on environmental factors, (2) calculation of relative productivity of cultivars in the environments, and (3) recommendation of cultivars of a specific type and range of adaptation. Soil and weather conditions were confirmed as the most important factors affecting winter wheat yield. The weather factors should be considered rather in shorter (e.g., 10 day) than longer (e.g., 60 day) time periods and in relation to growth stages. The ANCOVA model with genotype and management intensity as fixed factors, and soil and weather parameters as covariates was proposed to assess the expected wheat productivity in particular environments and the expected performance of each genotype (cultivar). The recommendation of cultivars for locations of specified productivity was proposed based on the difference between the expected cultivar yield and the mean wheat productivity, and compared with the Polish official cultivar recommendation list.

In general, the higher-yielding cultivars under inversion tillage conditions gave lower yields under non-inversion tillage, whereas low-yielding older cultivars showed relatively smaller reductions in yield under non-inversion tillage. A few cultivars showed preferential yield performance for either inversion or non-inversion tillage and this was irrespective of their overall yield performance. There was no pedigree or breeding programme link between these cultivars and no above-ground gross morphological trait observed was associated with tillage adaptation. Root hairs may contribute to inversion tillage adaptation as a root hair absence mutant was associated with non-inversion adaptation and it is likely that other root-associated traits are responsible also for tillage adaptation. There was no overall cultivar or tillage interaction with rhynchosporium symptoms but a differential tillage interaction may occur in individual years. We have identified clearly contrasting cultivars and tested their across-season robustness with respect to tillage treatment for further detailed mechanistic studies and identification of tillage adaptation traits.

The Northern Grains Region (NGR) of Australia, which accounts for nearly 95% of chickpea production in Australia, is frequently subjected to such events. The objective of this study was to map frost risk in chickpea in the NGR and develop strategies to minimise the impacts of such risk. The Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework was used to determine spatial and temporal trends in post-flowering frost risk. The NGR could be divided into six broad sub-regions, each delineating locations with similar frost risk. The risk was nearly two to three times greater in the Southern Downs and Darling Downs sub-regions as compared to the Central Queensland Highlands, Dawson Callide, New South Wales, and Northern New South Wales\u2013Western Downs sub-regions. There was an increasing trend in the frequency of frost events in the Southern Downs and New South Wales sub-regions, and a decreasing trend in the Central Queensland Highlands and Dawson Callide sub-regions, consistent with the changing climate of the NGR. In each sub-region, frost risk declined with delayed sowings, but such sowings resulted in simulation of reduced water limited yield potential (unfrosted) as well. The model output was also used to compute 10, 30, 50, and 70% probabilities of the last day of experiencing \u22123 to 2 \u00b0C minimum temperatures and identify the earliest possible sowings that would avoid such temperatures after flowering. Choosing the earliest sowing times with a 30% frost risk could help increase overall yields in environments with high frost risk. Simulations involving genotype x environment x management interactions suggested additional opportunities to minimise frost losses through the adoption of particular cultivars of differing phenology and the use of different agronomy in various environments of the NGR. The study indicates that there is considerable variation in frost risk across the NGR and that manipulating flowering times either through time of sowing or cultivar choice could assist in minimising yield losses in chickpea due to frost.

Over recent decades there has been growing appreciation that the prime involvement of clay minerals in the geochemical cycling of elements and pedosphere genesis should take into account the biogeochemical activity of microorganisms. Microbial intimate interaction with clay minerals, that has taken place on Earth\u2019s surface in a geological time-scale, represents a complex co-evolving system which is challenging to comprehend because of fragmented information and requires coordinated efforts from both clay scientists and microbiologists. This review covers some important aspects of the interactions of clay minerals with microorganisms at the different levels of complexity, starting from organic molecules, individual and aggregated microbial cells, fungal and bacterial symbioses with photosynthetic organisms, pedosphere, up to environmental and biotechnological implications.

However, demonstrating this process in a scientific manner entails substantial endeavors from different disciplines. In the present review, we will describe the features of a native vegetation system traditionally used by small ruminants and use its particularities to build an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate the nutraceutical properties of plants. Initially, we will establish the context of the low deciduous forest (LDF), considering some botanical and nutritional aspects, as well as the presence of plant secondary compounds (PSC) and gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Furthermore, we will focus on coevolutionary aspects that undoubtedly shaped the plants\u2013nutrients\u2013PSC\u2013GIN\u2013herbivore relationship. In addition, the concept of nutraceutical will be discussed to provide clarity and aspects to be considered for their evaluation.

Special focus is given to condensed tannins, as they are the fourth largest group of PSCs and the most studied in livestock sciences. Validation of the nutraceutical properties of plants from native vegetation systems should be seen as a process derived from many scientific disciplines that feed into each other in a cyclic manner.

The aim of this study is to quantify and analyze the trends of BSP in winter wheat seasons using the decision support system for agrotechnologie transfer (DSSAT) model under a long-term fertilization experiment in the dark loessal soil region of the Loess Plateau of China. In addition, we evaluated the contribution percentage of BSP to yield and its influencing factors. A long-term fertilization experiment with a winter wheat/spring maize rotation was established in 1979 in a field of the Gaoping Agronomy Farm, Pingliang, Gansu, China, including six treatments: (1) no fertilizer as a control (CK), (2) chemical nitrogen fertilizer input annually (N), (3) chemical nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer input annually (NP), (4) straw return and chemical nitrogen fertilizer input annually plus phosphorus fertilizer added every second year (SNP), (5) manure input annually (M), and (6) M plus N and P fertilizers added annually (MNP). The application of the DSSAT-CERES-Wheat model showed a satisfactory performance with good Wilmott d-index (0.78~0.95) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) (7.03%~18.72%) values for the tested genetic parameters of winter wheat. After the 26-years experiment, the yield by BSP of winter wheat under the M and MNP treatment significantly increased, at the rate of 2.7% and 3.82% a year, respectively, whereas that of CK and N treatments significantly decreased, at the rate of 0.23% and 3.03%. Moreover, the average contribution percentage of BSP to yield was 47.0%, 39.4%, 56.3%, 50.0%, and 61.9% in N, NP, SNP, M, and MNP treatments, respectively. In addition, soil organic carbon contents were the main controls of BSP under the different fertilization conditions in the dark loessial soil area. As a result, the combined application of organic fertilizer or straw and chemical fertilizer can be an effective form of fertilization management to greatly enrich basic soil productivity, continually promote the contribution percentage of BSP, and ultimately increase crop yield.

Fertilizer application influences overall soil characteristics, including soil microbial community composition and metabolic processes mediated by microbial enzymatic activity. Changes in the structure of microbial communities and their metabolic activity after long-term fertilization were studied in this research. We hypothesized that the different types of fertilization regimes affect nutrient levels in the soil which subsequently influence the metabolic processes and microbial diversity and community structure. Manure (MF; 330 kg N/ha), sewage sludge at two application doses (SF; 330 kg N/ha and SF3x; 990 kg N/ha) and chemical (NPK; N-P-K nutrients in concentrations of 330-90-300 kg/ha) fertilizers have been applied regularly to an experimental field since 1996. The microbial diversity increased in all soils amended with both organic (MF, SF, SF3x) and chemical (NPK) fertilizers. The shifts in microbial communities were observed, which were mainly caused by less abundant genera that were mostly associated with one or more fertilization treatment(s). Fertilization also influenced soil chemistry and the activity of \u03b2-xylosidase, \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), acid phosphatase and FDA-hydrolases. Specifically, all fertilization treatments were associated with a higher activity of \u03b2 xylosidase and lower NAG activity. Only the NPK treatment was associated with a higher activity of acid phosphatase.

Abiotic stresses such as drought, extreme temperatures, salinity, and nutrient deficiencies are causing increasing losses in terms of yield and product quality. The horticultural sector is therefore searching for innovative and sustainable agronomic tools to enhance crop tolerance towards these unfavorable conditions. In a recent review published in Agronomy, \u201cBiostimulants Application in Horticultural Crops under Abiotic Stress Conditions\u201d, Bulgari and colleagues discussed the main pieces of evidence of the use of biostimulants to manage abiotic stresses in vegetable crops. The intent of this editorial was to focus the attention on aspects related to the stress development in plants (i.e., timing and occurrence of multiple stress factors), in combination with the application of biostimulants. The large number of factors potentially involved in the enhancement of crop tolerance toward stress calls for an intensification of research activities, especially when conducted in field conditions and with well-defined protocols.

Despite the undeniable interest and potential impact of this view, it has been focused only on coincident regulatory aspects of SA and melatonin, and the antioxidant-mediated model of interaction that has been proposed is rather speculative and needs to be mechanistically demonstrated.

It has been hypothesized that many problems related to the burying of straw can be overcome by pyrolyzing it. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of straw and its biochar on the biomass production of perennial ryegrass. A pot-based experiment was conducted with three factors: (i) the crop species used as feedstock, (ii) raw or pyrolyzed organic material, and (iii) the rate of organic amendments. The soil in the pots was amended with straw and biochar produced from Miscanthus (Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus) or winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). After soil amendment application, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seeds were sown. During two years of the experiment, the perennial ryegrass above-ground biomass production and root biomass and morphology parameters were determined. Straw and biochar resulted in higher perennial ryegrass above-ground biomass compared with that of the non-fertilized control. However, straw amendment resulted in lower plant yields of above-ground biomass than those of the biochar treatments or the mineral fertilizer control treatment. The feedstock type (Miscanthus or wheat) significantly affected the perennial ryegrass yield. No difference was observed among wheat and Miscanthus biochar, while among straws, Miscanthus resulted in lower perennial ryegrass productivity (the higher rate of straw and biochar as soil amendments resulted in relatively high perennial ryegrass productivity). The organic amendments resulted in relatively high root biomass and length. The root:shoot ratio was lower in the treatments in which biochar was used, whereas feedstock species and amendment rate were not statistically significant for any of the root biomass and morphometric parameters. The results suggest that the use of pyrolyzed straw can be a reliable strategy instead of straw, increasing ryegrass growth and productivity.

Today, many bioenergy cropping systems (BCS) are suboptimal due to either social-ecological threats or technical limitations. In addition, the competition for land between bioenergy-crop cultivation, food-crop cultivation, and biodiversity conservation is expected to increase as a result of both continuous world population growth and expected severe climate change effects. This study investigates how BCS can become more social-ecologically sustainable in future. It brings together expert opinions from the fields of agronomy, economics, meteorology, and geography. Potential solutions to the following five main requirements for a more holistically sustainable supply of biomass are summarized: (i) bioenergy-crop cultivation should provide a beneficial social-ecological contribution, such as an increase in both biodiversity and landscape aesthetics, (ii) bioenergy crops should be cultivated on marginal agricultural land so as not to compete with food-crop production, (iii) BCS need to be resilient in the face of projected severe climate change effects, (iv) BCS should foster rural development and support the vast number of small-scale family farmers, managing about 80% of agricultural land and natural resources globally, and (v) bioenergy-crop cultivation must be planned and implemented systematically, using holistic approaches. Further research activities and policy incentives should not only consider the economic potential of bioenergy-crop cultivation, but also aspects of biodiversity, soil fertility, and climate change adaptation specific to site conditions and the given social context. This will help to adapt existing agricultural systems in a changing world and foster the development of a more social-ecologically sustainable bioeconomy.

Measurement of soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution at regional and global scale is needed for the prediction of flood, drought, planning and management of agricultural productivity to ensure food security. Recent advancement in microwave remote sensing, especially after the launch of Sentinel operational satellites has enabled the scientific community to estimate soil moisture at higher spatial and temporal resolution with greater accuracy. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1A satellite images to estimate soil moisture in a semi-arid region. Exactly at the time when satellite passes over the study area, we have collected soil samples at 37 different locations and measured the soil moisture from 5 cm below the ground surface using ML3 theta probe. We processed the soil samples in laboratory to obtain volumetric soil moisture using the oven dry method. We found soil moisture measured from calibrated theta probe and oven dry method are in good agreement with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.025 m /m and coefficient of determination (R ) 0.85. We then processed Sentinel-1A images and applied modified Dubois model to calculate relative permittivity of the soil from the backscatter values ( ). The volumetric soil moisture at each pixel is then calculated by applying the universal Topp\u2019s model. Finally, we masked the pixels whose Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value is greater than 0.4 to generate soil moisture map as per the Dubois NDVI criterion. Our modelled soil moisture accord with the measured values with RMSE = 0.035 and R = 0.75. We found a small bias in the modelled soil moisture ( ). However, this has reduced significantly ( ) after applying a bias correction based on Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching. Our approach provides a first-order estimate of soil moisture from Sentinel-1A images in sparsely vegetated agricultural land.

A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed using parental lines ICCV 10 (salt-tolerant) and DCP 92-3 (salt-sensitive) was screened under field conditions to collect information on agronomy, yield components, and stress tolerance indices. Genotyping data generated using Axiom\u00aeCicerSNP array was used to construct a linkage map comprising 1856 SNP markers spanning a distance of 1106.3 cM across eight chickpea chromosomes. Extensive analysis of the phenotyping and genotyping data identified 28 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining up to 28.40% of the phenotypic variance in the population. We identified QTL clusters on CaLG03 and CaLG06, each harboring major QTLs for yield and yield component traits under salinity stress. The main-effect QTLs identified in these two clusters were associated with key genes such as calcium-dependent protein kinases, histidine kinases, cation proton antiporter, and WRKY and MYB transcription factors, which are known to impart salinity stress tolerance in crop plants. Molecular markers/genes associated with these major QTLs, after validation, will be useful to undertake marker-assisted breeding for developing better varieties with salinity tolerance.

The experimental and accurate determination of soil moisture is a matter of great importance in different scientific fields, such as agronomy, soil physics, geology, hydraulics, and soil mechanics. This paper focuses on the experimental characterization of a commercial low-cost \u201ccapacitive\u201d coplanar soil moisture sensor that can be housed in distributed nodes for IoT applications. It is shown that at least for a well-defined type of soil with a constant solid matter to volume ratio, this type of capacitive sensor yields a reliable relationship between output voltage and gravimetric water content.

A bibliometric mapping analysis of the research on sugarcane was carried out, using data on the titles, abstracts, and keywords of articles published in leading journals and other peer-reviewed documents available in the SCOPUS database from 1858 to 2019 (27 August), and this was subsequently analyzed with the software VOSviewer. The three most important countries that publish research and were most-cited regarding sugarcane were Brazil, the USA, and India. The analysis of the co-occurrence of terms shows that the main research areas were sugarcane bagasse and terms related to bioenergy, and on a second level of relevance agronomy topics related to increasing crop yields. This first attempt to visualize the abundance of publications regarding sugarcane in their totality is in itself a good starting point for further scientific discussion.

Exogenous application of miPEPs increases the expression of their corresponding miRNA and, consequently, induces consistent phenotypical changes. Therefore, miPEPs carry huge potential in agronomy as gene regulators that do not require genome manipulation. However, to this end, it is necessary to know their mode of action, including where they act and how they enter the plants. Here, after analyzing the effect of Arabidopsis thaliana miPEP165a on root and aerial part development, we followed the internalization of fluorescent-labelled miPEP165a into roots and compared its uptake into endocytosis-altered mutants to that observed in wild-type plants treated or not with endocytosis inhibitors. The results show that entry of miPEP165a involves both a passive diffusion at the root apex and endocytosis-associated internalization in the differentiation and mature zones. Moreover, miPEP165a is unable to enter the central cylinder and does not migrate from the roots to the aerial part of the plant, suggesting that miPEPs have no systemic effect.

However, parameterizing ET in croplands can be challenging due to the wide variety of irrigation strategies and techniques, crop varieties, and management approaches that employ traditional tabular ET and make crop coefficient approaches obsolete. This special issue of Agronomy highlights nine approaches to improve the measurement and modeling of ET across a range of spatial and temporal resolutions and differing environments that address some of the challenges encountered.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as an important source of data for monitoring surface water, especially under inclement weather conditions, and is used operationally for flood mapping applications. The canopy penetration capability of the microwaves also allows for mapping of flooded vegetation as a result of enhanced backscatter from what is generally believed to be a double-bounce scattering mechanism between the water and emergent vegetation. Recent investigations have shown that, under certain conditions, the SAR response signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent during repeat satellite over-passes, which can be exploited for interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements to estimate changes in water levels and water topography. InSAR results also suggest that coherence change detection (CCD) might be applied to wetland monitoring applications. This study examines wetland vegetation characteristics that lead to coherence in RADARSAT-2 InSAR data of an area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands, and determines the annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multi-temporal radar data. The results for a three-year period demonstrate that most swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the ice-/snow-free time period for the 24-day repeat cycle of RADARSAT-2. However, open water areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation. We have found that wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least variance; wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence, but also high variability of coherence; and wetlands with shrub cover exhibit high coherence, but variability intermediate between treed and herbaceous wetlands. From this knowledge, we have developed a novel image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence and its variability with radar brightness (backscatter intensity). This product clearly displays the multitude of small wetlands over a wide area. With an interpretation key we have also developed, it is possible to distinguish different wetland types and assess year-to-year changes. In the next few years, satellite SAR systems, such as the European Sentinel and the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will provide rapid revisit capabilities and standard data collection modes, enhancing the operational application of SAR data for assessing wetland conditions and monitoring water levels using InSAR techniques.

Grafting is a technique used to alleviate these problems. Shortage of water has stimulated the introduction of new irrigation methods: deficit irrigation (DI) and partial root-zone drying (PRD). This study was conducted in two spring\u2013summer season experiments to evaluate the effects of three irrigation regimes: full irrigation (FI), PRD and DI on vegetative growth, leaf gas-exchange parameters, yield, water-use efficiency (WUE), nutrients profile and fruit quality of grafted tomatoes. In both years, the commercial rootstocks Emperador and Maxifort were used. In the first year, the scion cultivar Clarabella was grown on one stem and in the second year the cultivar Attiya was grown on two stems. Self-grafted cultivars were grown as a control. In both experiments, higher vegetative traits (leaf area and number, height, shoot biomass) were recorded in tthe plants grafted on commercial rootstocks. The stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were higher under FI. Under DI, transpiration was lowest and photosynthetic WUE was highest. Photosynthetic rate changed between irrigation treatments depending on plant type. In both years, the total yield was highest in grafted plants as result of more and bigger fruits per plant. In the 2nd year, grafted plants under FI had higher yield compared to PRD, but not to DI, while self-grafted plants did not differ between irrigation treatments. WUE was highest in DI and PRD treatments and in grafted plants. Leaf N, P, K and Ca was highest in tthe plants grafted on Emperador and Maxifort, while more Mg was measured in self-grafted plants. More Ca and Mg were recorded in tthe plants under DI and PRD. Fruit mineral concentrations were higher in tthe plants grafted on commercial rootstocks. Total soluble solids differed between irrigation regarding plant types, while fruit total acidity was higher in Emperador and Maxifort. In conclusion, our study showed that grafted plants could be grown under DI with minor yield reduction with 30\u201340% less water used for irrigation. Moderate DI could be used before PRD for cultivation of grafted tomato and double stemmed plants did not show negative effect on tomato yield so it can be used as standard under reduced irrigation.

In this study, three tomato hybrid (F1) cultivars were grown for year-round production in a commercial semi-closed glasshouse in Southern Italy: two of the cherry fruit-type (\u2018Juanita\u2019 and \u2018Sorentyno\u2019) and one mini plum fruit-type (\u2018Solarino\u2019). From 120 to 243 days after transplant, light-emitting diode (LED) toplights were used as SL, with a photoperiod of 18 h. The main climatic parameters inside and outside the glasshouse were recorded, and tomato plants\u2019 development and yield were examined. Plants grown with LEDs had longer stems as compared to control treatment (9.53 vs. 8.79 m), a higher stem thickness and yielded more trusses. On average, the yield was 21.7% higher with LEDs. \u2018Sorentyno\u2019 was the cultivar with the highest cumulated productivity when it was grown under SL. However, the cultivar with best light use efficiency under LEDs was \u2018Solarino\u2019. Therefore, supplemental LED from mid-December until March enhanced tomato growth and yield, opening a favorable scenario for large-scale application of this technology also in the Mediterranean area.

The aim of this study was to develop an agricultural management platform, based on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) principles and with the ability to collect geolocated information from different plots related to Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) wine production. First a survey to farmers, technicians and PDO and PGI managers was carried out to detect the needs of the three groups in relation to ERP platforms; and secondly an ERP platform was developed to collect agronomic information to comply with the Spanish legal requirements. Results showed that the end user completes information database, complies with the legal requirements, and obtains benefits derived from the data analysis. Consequently, the platform (i) solves lack of agricultural data problem; (ii) provides the user with management tools for its agricultural operations; (iii) allows the decision maker to obtain geolocated information in real time; and (iv) sets out the bases for the future development of agricultural systems based on Big Data.

Three independent transgenic lines ectopically overexpressing either barley FC1 or FC2 were selected and evaluated under well-watered, drought, and oxidative stress conditions. Both HvFC1 and HvFC2 overexpressing transgenics showed delayed wilting and maintained higher photosynthetic performance relative to controls, after exposure to soil dehydration. In each case, HvFC overexpression significantly upregulated the nuclear genes associated with detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon drought stress. Overexpression of HvFCs, also suppressed photo-oxidative damage induced by the deregulated tetrapyrrole biosynthesis mutant tigrinad12. Previous studies suggest that only FC1 is implicated in stress defense responses, however, our study demonstrated that both FC1 and FC2 affect drought stress tolerance. As FC-derived free heme was proposed as a chloroplast-to-nuclear signal, heme could act as an important signal, stimulating drought responsive nuclear gene expression. This study also highlighted tetrapyrrole biosynthetic enzymes as potential targets for engineering improved crop performance, both in well-watered and water-limited environments.

Fruit quality parameters were influenced by rootstocks, and this effect was mostly harvest time -dependent. External color was overall influenced by rootstocks upon the first harvest. FA13 and C35 induced a breakthrough in color change, while V17 brought about the greatest color increase. CL and V17 initially delayed the fruit maturity index. In the last harvest, while CL had one of the highest maturity indices, V17 exhibited the lowest as acidity was maintained as harvest advanced. The CC and M fruit had the highest and lowest sucrose content, respectively. The highest glucose and fructose contents in fruit were induced by V17, FA5 and CC. The highest citric acid content was displayed by V17 in all the harvests. The FA13, C35 and VK fruit exhibited the highest malic acid content. The effect that rootstock exert on ascorbic acid and flavonoid content depends on the studied season.

Enzyme pools were represented by B1 host (crude cellulase/xylanase complexes of Penicillium verruculosum); B1-XylA (Penicillium canescens xylanase A expressed in P. verruculosum B1 host strain); and F10 (Aspergillus niger \u03b2-glucosidase expressed in B1 host strain). Enzyme loading was 10 mg protein/g dry substrate and 40 U/g of \u03b2-glucosidase (F10) activity. SCB was efficiently hydrolyzed by B1 host after alkaline pretreatment, yielding glucose and reducing sugars at 71 g/L or 65 g/100 g of dry pretreated substrate and 91 g/L or 83 g/100 g, respectively. B1 host performed better also for EFB, regardless of the pretreatment method, but yields were lower (glucose 27\u201330 g/L, 25\u201327 g/100 g; reducing sugars 37\u201342 g/L, 34\u201338 g/100 g). SBH was efficiently saccharified by the combination of B1 host and B1-XylA, yielding similar concentrations of reducing sugars for both pretreatments (92\u201396 g/L, 84\u201387 g/100 g); glucose recovery, however, was higher with alkaline pretreatment (81 g/L, 74 g/100 g). Glucose and reducing sugar yields from initial substrate mass were 42% and 54% for SCB, 36% and 42\u201347% for SBH and 16\u201318% and 21\u201326% for EFB, respectively.

The soil samples were collected from two fields under maize: one week (Ist sampling time) and six months (IInd sampling time) after fertilization. The laboratory experiment included determination of: catalase activity, dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass, and basal respiration; pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also measured. The silty Luvisol was characterized by higher biological activity than the sandy Arenosol. Biofertilizer addition to degraded soils increased the biological activity, even in reduced doses of additives used; however the responses of the tested microbiological indicators were different. Soil texture affected the positive biomass response to biofertilizers which was observed in samples from Ist sampling time in silty soil, while from IInd sampling time in sandy soil. Based on our results, we propose that Polifoska with microorganisms (used in full dose) may be optimal for silty soil. Polifoska (in reduced dose) and urea (both in full and reduced dose) may be recommended for sandy soils. Increasing pH was a stronger driver of soil biological activity than DOC. Long-term field testing is suggested for validating our results.

Despite a substantial number of studies on this species, the genetic diversity and population structure have not yet been analyzed. Here, we use a next-generation sequencing-based Diversity Array Technology sequencing (DArT-seq) technique to analyze Polish gene bank accessions that originated from wild populations and cultivars. The major and, also, the most astounding result of our work is the low level of observed heterozygosity of individual plants from natural populations, despite the fact that the species is widespread in the studied area. Inbreeding in naturally outcrossing species such as valerian decreases reproductive success. The analysis of the population structure showed the potential presence of a metapopulation in the central part of Poland and the formation of a distinct gene pool in the Bieszczady Mountains. The results also indicate the presence of the cultivated gene pool within wild populations in the region where the species is cultivated for the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, and this could lead to structural and genetic imbalances in wild populations.

Water deficit and heat stress both significantly reduce the yield of grain legumes, and the faba bean is considered particularly susceptible. The genetic improvement of faba bean for drought adaptation (water deficit tolerance) by conventional methods and molecular breeding is time-consuming and laborious, since it depends mainly on selection and adaptation in multiple sites. The lack of high-throughput screening methodology and low heritability of advantageous traits under environmental stress challenge breeding progress. Alternatively, selection based on secondary characters in a controlled environment followed by field trials is successful in some crops, including faba beans. In general, measured features related to drought adaptation are shoot and root morphology, stomatal characteristics, osmotic adjustment and the efficiency of water use. Here, we focus on the current knowledge of biochemical and physiological markers for legume improvement that can be incorporated into faba bean breeding programs for drought adaptation.

Combinations of drought and soil-borne Fusarium-instigated diseases are the most common combinations of stresses, significantly reducing wheat yield around the world. Here, were analyzed the potential of application of endophytic bacteria Bacillus subtilis (strain 10\u20134) together with the natural signal molecule salicylic acid (SA) to improve growth and tolerance of Triticum aestivum L. (wheat) plants under combined drought and Fusarium culmorum-instigated root rot (FRR) stresses. It was revealed that pre-sowing treatment with B. subtilis 10\u20134, SA, and B. subtilis 10\u20134 + SA, both under normal and combined drought conditions, notably reduced (by 50\u201380% or more) the incidence of FRR development in wheat plants, with the most notable effect for B. subtilis 10\u20134 + SA (wherein disease symptoms were almost absent). Moreover, B. subtilis 10\u20134, SA, and especially B. subtilis 10\u20134 + SA increased plant growth (root and shoot length, fresh and dry biomass) under normal (up to 20\u201350%), drought (up to 15\u201340%), FRR (up to 15\u201330%), and combined drought + FRR stresses (up to 20%), with the maximum effect for B. subtilis 10\u20134 + SA. Additionally, B. subtilis 10\u20134, SA, and B. subtilis 10\u20134 + SA decreased stress (drought, FRR, and combined drought + FRR)-instigated lipid peroxidation and osmotic damages of plant cells. The findings indicate that endophytic bacteria B. subtilis 10\u20134 alone and in a mixture with SA may be used as an effective eco-friendly agent to improve wheat growth and tolerance under the influence of drought, FRR, and combinations of these stresses.

During the winter months in the greenhouse production industry, the supplemental lighting required to keep up production levels results in high expenditure. Current technology uses broadband high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, which is not the most efficient light source for crop production. Recent breakthroughs in the development of light source technologies have led to new opportunities for the use of sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of LEDs (light-emitting diodes) for greenhouse lighting. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of using photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) light for cucumber yielding, production processes and its influence on the variable costs in the cultivation of cucumbers using three different types of lighting. The research was carried out using three individual greenhouse growing area compartments, whereby the plants contained within were lit using three combinations: 1. HPS standard illumination from top HPS sodium lamps\u2014control, 2. HPS-LED\u2014HPS toplighting and LED interlighting, and 3. LED-LED\u2014100% LED lighting, both toplighting and interlighting with LED. The research was conducted in two independent winter crop cycles. The results of the research conducted indicate that the efficiency of light use was the highest in the LED-LED combination and the lowest in HPS, and the use of supplemental lamp lighting in the LED-LED combination (interlighting and toplighting) gives the most favorable surplus of all the variable costs over the value of production to be obtained. Despite the highest absolute level of variable costs in this type of supplemental lighting, the production value was higher by as much as 32.55% in relation to the HPS combination, which also translated into a gross margin that was higher by about \u00be. However, it is worth pointing out that, in the HPS-LED combination, the share of lighting and heating costs in the total value of production was the lowest. It is also a combination currently recommended in the literature as being the most beneficial in greenhouse production.

It is known for its good adaptation to different weather conditions, although it performs best in a warm and humid climate. Since the yield and various quality characteristics of vegetables are known to be strongly influenced by a number of weather, agronomic, and genetic (variety/cultivar) factors, in this study we aimed to compare three cultivars of courgette (Atena, Lajkonik and Soraya) grown in two consecutive growing seasons in the organic and conventional agronomic systems. The concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, \u03b2-carotene) and chlorophylls (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b) in courgette fruits were analyzed by HPLC. The growing season had a predominant effect on the yield as well as the majority of the analyzed compositional parameters of the courgette fruits. The studied cultivars differed significantly in the concentration of lutein, \u03b2-carotene, and chlorophylls, although some significant interactions between the cultivar and the growing season were observed. On average, organically grown courgettes were characterized by a significantly higher yield, as well as higher dry matter and chlorophyll content, however, this agronomic system\u2019s effect was not consistent among all the studied cultivars in the two seasons. The study suggests that organic practices have a potential to provide high yields of good quality crops, comparable (or, in the case of some parameters, better) than the conventional, resource-intensive horticulture.

Therefore, this research aims to study the impacts of moderate (MS), and high (HS) severity burn on N transformation and N losses, compared to an unburned (C) during the first year. The experimental plots (10 m2) were established in Croatia (43\u00b058\u2032 N 15\u00b031\u2032 E), in a slope ~18\u00b0, with a southwest exposition. Five days after the burn, C treatment had a significantly higher total N (TN) than MS and HS. Generally, the runoff was significantly different between burned and C treatments. Sediment yield, concentrations, and TN loss were significantly higher in MS than in C treatment. The concentrations of ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) in the runoff, and their losses were higher in burn treatments than in C treatment. These values were high in the first three months after burn, although the peaks in later periods correspond to extreme rainfall events. Principal component analysis showed that sediment yield was associated with sediment concentration, runoff, and TN loss (Factor 1). In addition, rainfall amount and intensity were inversely related to NH4-N concentration and losses (Factor 2). The NO3-N concentration was positively related to NO3-N losses. Overall, MS treatment had severe effects on N loss and, sediment yield can be used as an indicator of soil degradation after pile burns.

Using conventional crossings and the embryo-rescue techniques the following interspecific hybrids were developed: 11 genotypes of F1 generation, 18 genotypes of F2 and F1 \u00d7 F2 generations (produced after self- and cross-pollination of interspecific F1 hybrids), 10 plants of the BC1 generation (resulted from crossing head cabbage cytoplasmic male-sterile lines with interspecific hybrids of the F2 and F1 generations) and 8 plants of BC1 \u00d7 (F1 \u00d7 F2). No viable seeds of the BC2 generation (B. oleracea) were obtained due to the strong incompatibility and high mortality of embryos. The morphological characteristics during the vegetative and generative stages, pollen characteristics, seed development and propagation, nuclear DNA contents and genome compositions of interspecific hybrids were analyzed. All the interspecific F1 hybrids were male-fertile with a majority of undeveloped and malformed pollen grains. They showed intermediate values for morphological traits and nuclear DNA contents and had nearly triploid chromosomal numbers (27 to 29) compared with parental lines. The F2 generation had a doubled nuclear DNA content, with 52 and 56 chromosomes, indicating their allohexaploid nature. F2 hybrids were characterized by a high heterosis of morphological characteristics, viable pollen and good seed development. F1 \u00d7 F2 hybrids were male-fertile with a diversified DNA content and intermediate pollen viability. BC1 plants were male-sterile with an intermediate nuclear DNA content between the F2 and head cabbage, having 28 to 38 chromosomes. Plants of the BC1 \u00d7 (F1 \u00d7 F2) generation were in majority male-fertile with 38\u201346 chromosomes, high seed set, high heterosis and intermediate values for morphological traits. The obtained interspecific hybrids are valuable as new germplasm for improving Brassica-breeding programs.

In the present study, a field trial was conducted using a randomized complete block design with four replicates to elucidate the effects of vermicompost application (compared to supplementation with chemical fertilizer and no fertilizer) on the productivity of ex vitro MD2 pineapple plants. Vermicompost was applied on the sandy loam soils at transplanting followed by a second application at 7 months after planting (MAP) at the rate of 10 t\u00b7ha\u22121, while chemical fertilizer was applied based on the recommended cultivation practice. Data analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the plants treated with vermicompost and chemical fertilizer in terms of the plant height, number of leaves, length and width of D-leaves, stomatal density and stomatal size. However, the fruits produced with vermicompost amendment were smaller in size but contained higher total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total solids, ascorbic acid and total chlorophyll content compared to the fruits produced from plants supplied with chemical fertilizer. Based on the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, the methanolic fruit extracts from the control plants showed the highest antioxidant potential, followed by those of plants treated with vermicompost and chemical fertilizer. On the other hand, the application of vermicompost reduced soil acidity and produced macro- and micronutrient contents (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Zn, B and Al) in the soil and plants that were comparable to or higher than those produced by the chemical fertilizer treatment. However, some of the nutrient contents observed in all treatments were lower than the recommended range for pineapple plant growth, suggesting that vermicompost or chemical fertilizer should not be used alone as a source of nutrients for ex vitro MD2 pineapple plants under these soil and field conditions. However, vermicompost can be used as a supplement to increase the fruit chemical quality and maintain the soil quality for agricultural sustainability.

However, the amount and diversity of these compounds in each fruit specimen depend on its genotype and on a number of environmental factors. This work describes the quantitative ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode-array (UHPLC-PDA) analysis of the capsinoids content in four varieties of pepper (\u2018Habanero\u2019, \u2018Habanero Roxo\u2019, \u2018Bode\u2019, and \u2018Malagueta\u2019) grown until different development stages in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. In all the varieties analyzed, capsiate was the only capsinoid found. The accumulation of capsiate, in all the pepper varieties, started from the 10th to the 20th day post-anthesis (dpa), and increased during the first days (between the 20th and the 27th dpa). From that moment a drastic reduction took place until the end of the ripening stage, except for \u2018Bode\u2019 peppers, where the capsiate content increased from the first harvest point on the 20th dpa up to the 76th dpa. The capsiate accumulation patterns over the development of the fruit has been related to the capsaicionoids accumulation patterns in the same samples of the four varieties of pepper. According to our results, the content evolution of both families of compounds will vary depending on each fruit\u2019s genotype, as well as on environmental conditions. No clear trends have been established and, therefore, an in-depth analysis under controlled conditions should be carried out.

In nursery production chain of tomato, pepper and melon, the use of seven CTs was evaluated in order to substitute, totally or partially, chemical treatments with propamocarb-hydrochloride (47.3%) and fosetyl-Al (27.7%), a fungicide for the pathogenic oomycetes control. In general, CTs increased plant growth parameters, as suggested by measurements of root length (+9.1% and +8.1%, on average, on tomato and pepper, respectively), stem diameter (+12% on average, on tomato), number of leaves (+2.6% on average, on melon), and fresh biomass (+8.2% on average, on melon) in comparison with the chemical control. CT from artichoke and fennel composted residues have had the major impact on nursery performances of tomato, pepper and melon. After the first treatment of the polystyrene trays with the fungicide at sowing, our results indicated that CT may replace it in the following seedling production cycle, securing vegetative characteristics of nursery plants similar to the chemical control, that may incite fast starting of transplants in the field stage.

Polyannual vegetation (meadows, poplar, and cane stands) is widely considered the most efficient tool for remediation (extraction of bioavailable fraction of contaminants), for undertaking safety measures (reducing the mobility of contaminants towards other environmental compartments), and for restoring the ecosystem services of contaminated agricultural sites (biomass production, groundwater protection, C storage, landscape quality improvement, and cultural and educational services). The roles of agronomic approaches will be reviewed by focusing on the various steps in the whole remediation process: (i) detailed environmental characterization; (ii) phytoremediation for reducing risks for the environment and human health; (iii) agronomic management for improving efficiency of phytoremediation; and (iv) biomass recycling in the win-win perspective of the circular economy.

Nevertheless, this sustainable practice has been only recently used for table grape viticulture, with results often contrasting. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a fescue (Festucaarundinacea Schreb.) cover crop on soil quality, yield, and grape qualitative parameters in a table grape vineyard (cv \u201cItalia\u201d) located in southern Italy, comparing results with the conventional tillage. Soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), microbial biomass C (MBC), \u03b2-glucosidase (BGLU) and alkaline phosphomonoesterase (APME) activities were assessed during three growing seasons (2012\u20132014) and three phenological stages. The trend of soil chemical and microbiological properties was jointly influenced by the soil management system, growing season and phenological stage. Compared to conventional tillage, cover crops increased, on average, soil organic C, total N, MBC, BGLU and APME by 136%, 93%, 112%, 100% and 62%, respectively. Slight or no effects of cover crops were observed on grape quality and yield, except for 2012 (the driest season), when a yield reduction occurred. This study reveals that cover crops strongly enhance soil quality in the short-term, with potential advantages for grape production in the long-term.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of two biostimulants on the bean yield and fiber fractions in seeds: neutral-detergent fiber, acid-detergent fiber, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. The field experiment performed in 2016\u20132018 in Poland. Over the growing season, plants were treated with biostimulants seaweed extracts (concentrations of 0.7% and 1%) and amino acids (0.3% and 0.5%) based products. Plants were sprayed a single time in the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and Chemical industry (BBCH) 13\u201315 phenological phases and a double spray in the BBCH 13\u201315 and 61. The study showed a significant increase in bean yield (average 32.08% compare to control) when seaweed extracts was used in the form of a double spray at a higher concentration. In the case of the application of amino acids-based product, the best results (increase of 21.97%) were obtained using a double spray at a lower concentration. It was found that the tested biostimulants changed the fiber fractions of bean seeds. The acid-detergent fiber (ADF) content was the highest (average increase of 2%) after double plant treatment with seaweed extracts based product. While the increased concentration of neutral-detergent fiber (NDF) (over 4%) resulted from double spraying with lower concentration of this biostimulant. The increase in the lignin (ADL) (1.12%), hemicellulose (HCEL) (4.54%), and cellulose (CEL) (0.91%) represented plant response to the double application of this biostimulant in the higher concentration. The results indicated also that the use of amino acids-based product caused an increase in the ADF (0.28%), NDF (10.27%), ADL (0.63%), and HCEL (9.99%) contents in bean seeds as an effect of double plant treatment with this biostimulant at lower concentration.

Five supplemental light emitting diode (LED) light intensity (LI) treatments provided canopy-level photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) ranging from 41 to 180 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s\u22121. With a 12-h photoperiod, the treatments provided 1.76 to 7.72 mol m\u22122 d\u22121 of supplemental light. Two cultivars of cut gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii H. Bolus ex Hook.f) were used to evaluate vegetative growth and flower production. Plugs of \u2018Ultima\u2019 were assessed for vegetative growth and rate of flower development. There were minor LI treatment effects on number of leaves and chlorophyll content index and flowers from plants under the highest versus the lowest LI matured 10% faster. Reproductively mature \u2018Panama\u2019 plants were assessed for flower yield and quality. \u2018Panama\u2019 flowers from the highest LI treatment had shorter stems than the three lowest LI treatments, and flowers from the middle LI treatment had larger diameter than the other treatments. Flowers from the lowest LI treatment had lower fresh mass than the three highest LI treatments. There were linear relationships between LI and numbers of flowers harvested, with the highest LI treatment producing 10.3 and 7.0 more total and marketable flowers per plant than the lowest LI treatment. In general, increasing levels of supplemental light had only minor effects on vegetative growth (young plants) and size and quality of harvested flowers (mature plants), but flowers from plants grown under higher LIs were more numerous and matured faster.

However, there are areas occupied by agriculture and woodlands with an essential role in provisioning food and other services such as water and climate regulation. The objective of this work was to assess the effect of long-term land use and soil management practices on peri-urban soils in Zagreb (Croatia). Samples were collected at depth 0\u201310 cm within intensively tilled cropland (CROP) and vineyard (VINE), traditional grass-covered orchard (ORCH), and forest (FOR). The results showed that bulk density was significantly higher in VINE and CROP than in ORCH and FOR. The opposite dynamic was observed in water-holding capacity, air-filled porosity, aggregate stability, organic matter, and soil organic matter stocks (SOCS). Soil water infiltration was higher in FOR plot compared to the other plots. Overall, land-use change had a substantial impact on soil properties and SOCS, especially in CROP and VINE soils. Tillage, pesticides, and fertilizer applications were presumably the reasons for altered soil quality properties. Intensively used areas (VINE and CROPS) may reduce soil ecosystems services such as the capacity for flood retention and C sequestration.

In the context of farm-to-door mode, the fresh retailers could incorporate the postharvest maturity time, picking time and distribution time to deliver high-quality fruits to consumers. This study selects climacteric tomato fruits and formulates a postharvest maturity model by capturing the firmness and soluble solid content (SSC) data during maturing. A joint picking and distribution model is proposed to ensure tomatoes could arrive at consumers within expected maturity time windows. To improve the feasibility of proposed model, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is designed to obtain solutions. The results demonstrate that the joint model could optimize the distribution routing to improve consumer satisfaction and reduce the order fulfillment costs. The proposed method provides precise guidance for tomato online retailers by taking advantage of postharvest maturity data, which is conducive to sustainable development of fresh e-ecommerce.

The role of roots in supporting these goals has been largely ignored. With the increasing need to produce more food, feed, fiber, and fuel on less land and with fewer inputs, the next advance in plant breeding must include greater consideration of roots. Root traits are an untapped source of phenotypic variation that will prove essential for breeders working to increase yields and the provisioning of ecosystem services. Roots are dynamic, and their structure and the composition of metabolites introduced to the rhizosphere change as the plant develops and in response to environmental, biotic, and edaphic factors. The assessment of physical qualities of root system architecture will allow breeding for desired root placement in the soil profile, such as deeper roots in no-till production systems plagued with drought or shallow roots systems for accessing nutrients. Combining the assessment of physical characteristics with chemical traits, including enzymes and organic acid production, will provide a better understanding of biogeochemical mechanisms by which roots acquire resources. Lastly, information on the structural and elemental composition of the roots will help better predict root decomposition, their contribution to soil organic carbon pools, and the subsequent benefits provided to the following crop. Breeding can no longer continue with a narrow focus on aboveground traits, and breeding for belowground traits cannot only focus on root system architecture. Incorporation of root biogeochemical traits into breeding will permit the creation of germplasm with the required traits to meet production needs in a variety of soil types and projected climate scenarios.

The developed control strategy is based on a PI (Proportional-Integral) controller combined with feedforward compensators to improve the performance against measurable external disturbances such as outside air temperature, solar radiation, and wind velocity. Since the greenhouse process dynamics is very complex and physical non-linear models are mathematically complicated, a system identification methodology was proposed to obtain simpler models (high-order polynomial and low-order transfer functions). Thus, an easier procedure was completed to tune the PI controller parameters and to obtain the feedforward compensators expressions by following a series of modern and simple tuning rules. Simulations with real data were executed to compare the control performance of a PI controller with or without the addition of feedforward compensators. Moreover, real tests for the developed control strategy were carried out in an experimental greenhouse. Results demonstrate an enhanced control performance with the presence of the feedforward compensators under different weather conditions.

They provide numerous ecosystem services (ES), but their supply may be negatively affected by agricultural management. We conducted a literature review to identify which ES are supplied by kettle holes and to analyze feedbacks with agricultural management. Taking Germany as a test case, we also analyzed how kettle holes are addressed in policy documents and for which ES they are regulated. This was done to identify the societal value officially associated with kettle holes. The literature review found eight ES attributed to kettle holes, of which hydrological cycle and flood control, chemical condition of freshwaters, nursery populations and habitats and biotic remediation of wastes were addressed most often. In contrast, only the provision of habitat service was addressed in German policy documents related to kettle holes. We identified types of agricultural management that negatively affected the supply of ES by kettle holes, in particular artificial drainage, high levels of pesticide and fertilizer application, and management where tillage and erosion result in elevated sediment inputs. Additionally, climate change may lead to an increased drying up of kettle holes. Based on our finding, we conclude that the intensity of agricultural management around kettle holes threatens the supply of all ES while only the service of providing habitats for biodiversity is addressed in German policy regulations. Further regulation is required to induce agricultural management change towards a conservation of all ES supplied by kettle holes.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the genetic diversity of 162 early maturing white and yellow tropical maize inbred lines, and to determine the population structure, heterotic groups and inter-trait relationships among the lines. Using 9684 DArT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, a gene diversity (GD) of 0.30 was recorded for the inbred lines with polymorphic information content (PIC) ranging from 0.08 to 0.38. The genetic relatedness among the inbred lines evaluated revealed six different groups based on the history of selection, colour of endosperm and pedigree. The genotype-by-trait (GT) biplot analysis identified inbred 1 (TZEI 935) as outstanding in terms of combined heat and drought (HD) tolerance with the base index analysis identifying 15 superior inbreds in the HD environment. A wide range of genetic variability was observed among the inbred lines, indicating that they are an invaluable resource for breeding for HD tolerance in maize breeding programmes, especially in West and Central Africa.

Plants have developed specific mechanisms that perceive the stress signals and respond to external environmental changes via different mitigation strategies. Abscisic acid (ABA), being one of the phytohormones, serves as an important signaling mediator for plants\u2019 adaptive response to a variety of environmental stresses. ABA triggers many physiological processes, including bud dormancy, seed germination, stomatal closure, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of stress-responsive gene expression. The site of its biosynthesis and action must be clarified to understand the signaling network of ABA. Various studies have documented multiple sites for ABA biosynthesis, their transporter proteins in the plasma membrane, and several components of ABA-dependent signaling pathways, suggesting that the ABA response to external stresses is a complex networking mechanism. Knowing about stress signals and responses will increase our ability to enhance crop stress tolerance through the use of various advanced techniques. This review will elaborate on the ABA biosynthesis, transportation, and signaling pathways at the molecular level in response to drought stress, which will add a new insight for future studies.

Conventional methods such as salt-leaching or application of soil amendments, or nature-based solutions (NBSs) such as phytoremediation, have been widely adopted with contrasting results. The use of cyanobacteria for improving soil conditions has emerged as a novel biotechnological tool for ecosystem restoration due to the unique features of these organisms, e.g., ability to fix carbon and nitrogen and promote soil stabilisation. Cyanobacteria distribute over a wide range of salt concentrations and several species can adapt to fluctuating salinity conditions. Their application in agricultural saline soil remediation has been demonstrated, mostly in laboratory studies, but there is a lack of research regarding their use in natural ecosystems restoration. In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on cyanobacteria in the context of ecosystem restoration. Examples of the application of cyanobacteria in alleviating salt-stress in plants and soils are presented. Furthermore, we acknowledge gaps regarding the extensive application of cyanobacteria in salt-affected soils remediation and discuss the challenges of NBSs in salt-affected soils restoration.

Alkalinity and the high affinity of clinoptilolite zeolite (CZ) for macronutrients could improve pH, nutrient availability, and papaya productivity on peat soils. A one-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of CZ on: (i) soil ammonium, nitrate, P, and K, and (ii) growth, yield, and fruit quality of papaya grown on a peat soil. Treatments evaluated were: (i) different amounts of CZ (25%, 50%, 70%, and 100% of the existing recommended rate of CZ) + NPK fertilizer, and (ii) NPK fertilizer alone. The peat soils with CZ improved pH, ammonium, nitrate, P, and K availability because of the sorption of these nutrients within the structured framework of the CZ. Co-applying CZ (70% to 100%) and NPK fertilizers improved the NPK contents in papaya leaves and the growth, yield, and fruit quality of papaya because of the significant availability of ammonium, nitrate, P, and K in the peat soil for their optimum uptake by the papaya plants. Ability of CZ to buffer the soil pH reduced the need for liming. It is possible to use CZ to improve papaya productivity because CZ can regulate nutrient availability.

Samples were taken from three collection fields (Granaglione, Zocca and Paloneta) in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. The accessions were analyzed by using 16 microsatellite markers (SSR). Genetic distances among accessions, calculated through the DICE coefficient, were used to construct an UPGMA cluster analysis. One major genotype (named \u201cMarroni\u201d) was identified across the three investigated collection fields; this variety corresponds to a sweet chestnut cultivar that has been propagated and widely diffused in the Emilia-Romagna region. Other genotypes were represented by different varieties of Italian chestnuts.

While the developing countries of the world face many challenges regarding food security due to rapid population growth and limited agricultural resources, this study aimed to assess the soils of Sidi Barrani and Salloum using multivariate analysis to determine the land capability and crop suitability for potential alternative crop uses, based on using principal component analysis (PCA), agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (AHC) and the Almagra model of MicroLEIS. In total, 24 soil profiles were dug, to represent the geomorphic units of the study area, and the soil physicochemical parameters were analyzed in laboratory. The land capability assessment was classified into five significant classes (C1 to C5) based on AHC and PCA analyses. The class C1 represents the highest capable class while C5 is assigned to lowest class. The results indicated that about 7% of the total area was classified as highly capable land (C1), which is area characterized by high concentrations of macronutrients (N, P, K) and low soil salinity value. However, about 52% of the total area was assigned to moderately high class (C2), and 29% was allocated in moderate class (C3), whilst the remaining area (12%) was classified as the low (C4) and not capable (C5) classes, due to soil limitations such as shallow soil depth, high salinity, and increased erosion susceptibility. Moreover, the results of the Almagra soil suitability model for ten crops were described into four suitability classes, while about 37% of the study area was allocated in the highly suitable class (S2) for wheat, olive, alfalfa, sugar beet and fig. Furthermore, 13% of the area was categorized as highly suitable soil (S2) for citrus and peach. On the other hand, about 50% of the total area was assigned to the marginal class (S4) for most of the selected crops. Hence, the use of multivariate analysis, mapping land capability and modeling the soil suitability for diverse crops help the decision makers with regard to potential agricultural development.

We examined the effects of exogenous gibberellic acid (GA3) on the reproductive phenology, fruit number, yield, and fruit quality of three blackberry cultivars (\u2018Natchez\u2019, \u2018Navaho\u2019, and \u2018Ouachita\u2019) grown under subtropical climatic conditions in two consecutive growing seasons. A single spray application of GA3 at 0 or 49 g\u00b7ha\u22121 was performed when plants were dormant in late December to late January. Exogenous GA3 advanced the onset of budbreak by 12 to 82 days, flowering by four to 20 days, and fruit ripening by 0 to 15 days. When pooling across the cultivars, it also increased early-season yield by 83% to 276% in two consecutive growing seasons and total-season yield by 60% in the second growing season. Among the cultivars, the yield responses to GA3 were most consistent in \u2018Ouachita\u2019, with early-season yield increasing by up to 499%. The average berry weight and soluble solids concentration were slightly reduced by GA3, but these reductions were not consistent in the two growing seasons and the impact on overall fruit marketability was small. These results suggest that exogenous GA3 is an effective bud dormancy breaking compound for blackberry, and it could be an important adaptation tool for subtropical blackberry production.

Using three-dimensional fluorescence excitation\u2013emission matrices (3D-EEM) and high-throughput microbial sequencing, the characteristics of soil DOM and microbiota under realistic field conditions were estimated in the farming soils with long-term ecological (EM) and conventional management (CM). Specifically, the role of hedgerows in the ecologically managed land (EMH) was assessed. The total fluorescent intensity of soil DOM in the EMH system was significantly higher than the values in CM and EM systems. Additionally, the five normalized excitation\u2013emission area volumes from regional integration analysis increased in the order CM < EM < EMH. In comparison with CM and EM soils, the hedgerow significantly increased the evenness of the bacterial communities in the EMH system, whereas no differences were found for the alpha-diversity of eukaryotic communities. The composition of soil microbiota was significantly distinct among the three farming systems, with a hedgerow-specific effect on bacterial community and a management-specific effect on eukarya. The predicted functional profiles indicated that the hedgerow showed a higher contribution to the dissimilarity of bacterial functions. Furthermore, the distinction of the soil microbiota was modulated by the soil DOM composition and significantly positive correlations between the microbiota involved in nutrient cycling and soil DOM were observed. The findings in this work strengthen our understanding of the different responses of bacterial and eukaryotic communities under the long-term ecological management and highlight the beneficial roles of hedgerows in increasing organic matter and modulating community assembly.

To improve productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) under deficit irrigation, an effective water-saving technology that is characterized by three planting modes has been developed (uniform with 30-cm row spacing (U), double-double row spacing of 5 cm (DD), and furrow-ridge row spacing of alternated 20 cm and 40 cm (F)) combined with three irrigation regimes (50 mm water each at growth stage 34 (GS34) and GS48 (W1), and 100 mm water at GS48 (W2), or 100 mm each water at GS34 and GS48 (W3)). Results showed that DD increased yield by 9.7% and WUE by 12.6% due to higher soil water status and less soil water depletion and evapotranspiration compared with U. Although the soil water status, soil water depletion, evapotranspiration, and yield increased with increasing irrigation amount, more soil water depletion and evapotranspiration resulted in low WUE. The deficit irrigation was beneficial for improving WUE as W1 had significantly increased yield by 5.4% and WUE by 7.1% compared with W2. Yield and evapotranspiration showed a quadratic dynamic equation indicating that yield increased with increasing evapotranspiration. Considering WUE and relatively higher yield under deficit water, W1 combined with DD is suggested to be a good management strategy to be applied in winter wheat of water-scarce regions.

One of these elements is nitrogen, which is a major nutrient affecting crop production worldwide. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the impact of various EOM treatments (with and without mineral fertilization) on wheat yield characteristics and the dynamics of mineral nitrogen release. This study was conducted as a pot experiment using three soils characterized by different physicochemical properties, which were collected from the Polish\u2013Czech Republic transboundary area. A spring wheat (the Tybalt cultivar) was selected as the model test plant. The EOMs tested in the experiment included three soil amendments (animal meal, industrial compost, and digestate) characterized by different potential impacts on plant growth and development. The efficiency of the selected amendments was analyzed in two doses, set at 50% and 100% mineral nitrogen ratios (equivalent to 70 and 140 kg ha\u22121, respectively). The content of mineral nitrogen (N-NH4+ and N-NO3\u2212) in soils before sowing and after harvesting, and the quality and biomass of the wheat yield were determined. The application of an entire N rate in the form of EOM did not cause any decrease in the wheat yields or a clear diversification of the wheat biomass. However, the appropriate selection of rates and fertilizer combinations resulted in an increased amount of available nitrogen being introduced into the soil (a 9\u201331% and 17\u201338% increase of N-NH4+ in soils before sowing and after harvesting, respectively, and a 4\u201363% and 10\u201334% increase of N-NO3\u2212 in soils before sowing and after harvesting, respectively), which resulted in an increase in grain weight, reflecting yield and grain quality (from 2% to 12% higher grain weight compared to the control). The applied EOMs were characterized by readily transforming forms of organic nitrogen into N-NH4+ and further increasing the speed of its conversion into N-NO3\u2212, indicating the capacity of these treatments to act as substitutes for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.

Recent reports of the toxicity of MB to arthropod pests suggest that MB may be a useful alternative insecticide. The present study assessed the effects of a sublethal concentration of MB (LC30, 0.22%) on the life history and reproductive characteristics of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, in both a treated parental generation (F0) and untreated progeny (F1). MB treatment significantly decreased longevity and fecundity in both the F0 and F1 generations, and prolonged the developmental duration of each immature instar of the F1 generations, compared with controls. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (\u03bb), and net reproductive rate (R0) of the F1 generation were significantly reduced, compared to controls. The mode of action of MB is not known, but in aphids treated with LC30 MB, the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) decreased by more than 65%, compared with untreated controls. AChE activity was rapidly inhibited within 1 h, and remained inhibited for 6 h after in vivo exposure to MB. Moreover, molecular docking analysis revealed that MB had a strong affinity with the catalytic site of AChE, with a binding energy value of \u22126.2 kcal/mole. Our results suggest that MB targets AChE, and that a sublethal dose of MB can have adverse transgenerational effects on cotton aphids.

Bacillus velezensis strain PEA1 was isolated, characterized, and evaluated for antifungal and antiviral activities against Fusarium oxysporum MT270445 and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) MN594112. Our findings proved that strain PEA1 had intense antagonist activity against F.oxysporum. Under greenhouse conditions, the antiviral activities (protective, curative, and inactivation) of PEA1-culture filtrate (CF) on Datura stramonium plants were assayed, using a half-leaf method. The inactivation treatment exhibited the highest inhibition rate (97.56%) and the most considerable reduction of CMV-CP accumulation levels (2.1-fold) in PEA1-CF-treated plants when compared with untreated plants (26.9-fold). Furthermore, PEA1-CF induced systemic resistance with significantly elevated transcriptional levels of PAL, CHS, HQT, PR-1, and POD genes in D. stramonium leaves after all treatments. Gas chromatography\u2012mass spectrometry analysis showed that pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione is the main compound in the PEA1-CF ethyl acetate extract, which may act as an elicitor molecule that induces plant systemic resistance and inhibits both fungal growth and viral replication. Consequently, B. velezensis can be considered as a potential source for the production of bioactive compounds for the management of plant diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the antiviral activity of B. velezensis against plant viral infection.

Accordingly, interest has been increasing concerning its possible cultivation within protected environments through adoption of soilless cultivation technologies. The aim of the present study was to optimize nutrient solution features in the soilless cultivation of saffron corms. The trial was conducted in a greenhouse at Almeria University. Saffron was grown in 15-L pots filled with perlite. Three fertigation treatments were used, obtained by a linear increase of all nutrients of one standard in order to reach an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2.0 (control, EC2.0), 2.5 (EC2.5) and 3.0 (EC3.0) dS\u00b7m\u22121. Measurements included determinations of shoot length, corm yield, as well as nutrient uptake from the nutrient solution and concentrations within plant tissues. The nutrient solution with the highest EC (EC3.0) allowed obtaining three to five times more corms above 25-mm diameter. The increasing EC had a significant effect on the increase of macronutrient uptake, except for NO3\u2212 and NH4+ and resulted in a general increase of nutrient concentrations in tissues, such as corms and roots. Both macronutrient uptake and accumulation in plant tissues were highest under EC3.0. Nutrient uptake was significantly correlated with production of larger corms due to higher horizontal diameter.

The soil showed very high pseudototal and bioavailable concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), due to improper lead-acid batteries storage. Compost amendment in combination with the two biostimulants produced the best outcomes in terms of plant growth and nutrient uptake. The same mix of beneficial microbes improved soil biological fertility enhancing soil nitrogen fixing and ammonia oxidizing bacteria, while reduced the pore water and NH4NO3 extractable concentrations of Cd and at lower extent of Pb in soil. Accordingly, the lower mobility and bioavailability of Cd in soil determined a lower uptake and accumulation of Cd in shoots of different grass species. Our results suggest that a green cap with turfgrass assisted by biostimulants and compost amendment in PTE-contaminated industrial sites could be a reliable and effective practice to protect and restore soil biological fertility and to reduce the risk of PTE dispersion in the surrounding environment.

A matching library (ML) was created and evaluated against the fundamental parameters (FP) calibration using 20 ISE standards. Additionally, EDXRF results of 41 tillage soils were compared with Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) results. The PPB had most recoveries within the acceptable range of 80\u2013120%; conversely, PP yielded the poorest element recoveries. For the calibration, the ML provided better recoveries of Ni, Pb, Cu, Mg, S, P, and Cr; however, for Zn, and Mn, it had the opposite effect. Furthermore, EDXRF results compared with ICP-OES separated by soil texture class for Al, K, Mn, and Fe. In conclusion, the EDXRF is suitable for quantifying both trace elements and macronutrients in contaminated soils and has the potential to provide screening or prediction of soil texture in agriculture.

Drought and soil salinity, especially, are major causes of reduction of crop yields and food production worldwide. It is not unexpected, therefore, that the study of plant responses to abiotic stress and stress tolerance mechanisms is one of the most active research fields in plant biology. This Special Issue compiles 22 research papers and 4 reviews covering different aspects of these responses and mechanisms, addressing environmental stress factors such as drought, salinity, flooding, heat and cold stress, deficiency or toxicity of compounds in the soil (e.g., macro and micronutrients), and combination of different stresses. The approaches used are also diverse, including, among others, the analysis of agronomic traits based on morphological characteristics, physiological and biochemical studies, and transcriptomics or transgenics. Despite its complexity, we believe that this Special Issue provides a useful overview of the topic, including basic information on the mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance as well as practical aspects such as the alleviation of the deleterious effects of stress by different means, or the use of local landraces as a source of genetic material adapted to combined stresses. This knowledge should help to develop the agriculture of the (near) future, sustainable and better adapted to the conditions ahead, in a scenario of global warming and environmental pollution.

However, the increased farming operation times that often occur under large-scale farming conditions necessitate shortening the duration of rice growth, especially that of late-season rice; therefore, rice cultivars with short growth durations are popular under such conditions. A field experiment using two short-duration rice cultivars (SRCs), i.e., Jiuliangyou 3 and Shengyou 9520, and two long-duration rice cultivars (LRCs), i.e., Shengyou 957 and Tianyouhuazhan, was conducted in the late season in Yongan and Santang, Hunan Province, China in 2017 and 2018. The grain yield and yield attributes were compared between the SRCs and LRCs, showing that the SRCs, which exhibited an 11\u201312-day shorter growth period, revealed similar grain yield to the LRCs. The SRCs also exhibited a 10\u201331% higher spikelet filling rate and a 13% higher harvest index than the LRCs. Moreover, the biomass accumulation, crop growth rate, and apparent radiation use efficiency of the SRCs were significantly higher than those of the LRCs during the postheading phase. Our results indicate that the higher spikelet filling rate, the harvest index, and the apparent radiation use efficiency of the postheading period were the underlying factors for the SRCs\u2019 grain yield.

However, the nutrient uptake phenomenon has not been related well to the soilless culture system. Herein, we report on the design, theoretical analyses, and verification of a method for an online indicator related to plant nutritional aspects. Models for simulating nutrient and water transport in a porous medium were constructed for analyses of the nutrient uptake estimation method. In simulation analyses, we summarized the theoretical relationships between flow rates of total nutrients in a substrate and nutrient uptake. For concept validation, we conducted a greenhouse experiment for correlation analysis with the growth of tomato plants, conventional nutrient, and water management indicators, and developed online indicators related to plant nutritional aspects. Onsite application of the indicator showed a higher correlation with tomato yield than conventional management indicators, such as transpiration, irrigation, drainage ratio, leaching fraction, and electrical conductivity of drainage. In addition, to assess the usability of a nutrient uptake indicator as an onsite decision-making technique, data normalization was conducted. Through this, the time series responsiveness of a nutrient uptake indicator to the yield change was confirmed.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of rootstocks on yield and fruit quality of Mandared, a triploid pigmented mandarin. To do so, we established a rootstock field trial on a high pH soil (8.6) in which Mandared was grafted onto 11 rootstocks. These included some standard rootstocks, such as trifoliate orange ((Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.), Troyer citrange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. \u00d7 P. trifoliata), Swingle citrumelo (Citrus paradisi Macf. \u00d7 P. trifoliata), and C35 citrange (C. sinensis \u00d7 P. trifoliata), as well as new releases from the Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA, Acireale, Italy) and the University of California Riverside (UCR). The cumulative yield was measured over five consecutive years, while fruit quality was analyzed for two years. The trees on C35, C57 (Citrus sunki Hort. ex. Tan. \u00d7 P. trifoliata), and C22 (C. sunki \u00d7 P. trifoliata), started to set fruits one year earlier than the others. The trees on C57 provided some of the highest cumulative yields and canopy volumes. The production of Mandared grafted onto C57 was double that of Mandared grafted onto Troyer, while Mandared grafted onto C35 and C22 resulted in the best yield efficiency. The trees on Swingle and C57 significantly reduced the pre-harvest fruit drop, to which Mandared is particularly sensitive. However, grafting Mandared onto Swingle resulted in the highest variation among replicates, probably due to its high sensitivity to iron chlorosis. Most of the fruit quality parameters, such as fruit size, total soluble solids (TSS), and acidity were not significantly different among the rootstock treatments. However, fruits produced by Mandared grafted onto C22 had one of the highest rates of anthocyanin accumulation. The results indicate that C57, C35, and C22 were the most suitable rootstocks for Mandared in South-Eastern Sicily.

The aim of the three-year field experiment was to determine the efficiency of fertilization with a new fertilizer available on the Polish market and containing nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) in proportions designed for cereals cultivation (30% N and 6% S as ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate). Other treatments included no fertilization; fertilization with ammonium nitrate (34% N); fertilization with standard nitrogen and sulfur fertilizer with N supplementation with ammonium nitrate. Nitrogen doses were 150, 200, and 250 kg N ha\u22121. Sulfur was applied in doses of 30, 40, and 50 kg S ha\u22121. A beneficial effect of using fertilizer containing N and S in proportions designed for cereals cultivation was observed. The highest mean optimal nitrogen dose and maximum winter wheat yield were recorded for the new fertilizer (217 kg N ha\u22121 and 8251 kg ha\u22121, respectively). Sulfur supplementation with the new fertilizer significantly increased apparent nitrogen recovery (mean values 48.9%, 44.6%, and 40.6% for doses 150, 200, and 250 kg N ha\u22121, respectively), agronomic efficiency (11.1 and 8.6 kg kg\u22121 N for doses 200 and 250 kg N ha\u22121, respectively), and physiological efficiency (24.7 kg kg\u22121 N for dose 200 kg N ha\u22121).

The impact of agriculture on the environment varies depending on farming practices. The aim of the study was to assess and compare the environmental effects of the life cycle of winter wheat cultivation in three soil tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage, and no-tillage. The study was conducted in 2015\u20132017 on 15 agricultural farms located in the Wielkopolska region, Poland. The \u201ccradle-to-farm gate\u201d life cycle of wheat production was analysed using life cycle assessment methodology. The values of impact category indicators, especially in the case of global warming potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential, depended mainly on mineral fertilization. Wheat production generated more adverse emissions with increased nitrogen fertilization both in reduced tillage and no-tillage systems on the studied farms, and consequently resulted in a more negative impact on the environment compared to wheat cultivated in the conventional tillage system. After nitrogen fertilization, use of fossil fuel, and phosphorus and potassium fertilization were the top contributors to environmental impacts of winter wheat production in different tillage systems. The pre-production phase associated with the agricultural means of production was dominant in determining the analysed environmental impacts, except for global warming potential and photochemical ozone creation potential, which depended mainly on the production phase on the farm. The other key environmental impacts that should be considered when it comes to improvements in the life cycle of wheat production were depletion of mineral resources and acidification.

A hypothesis was formulated that the type of growth substrate (vermiculite, silty clay loam or sandy loam soil) and the cultivar affect the phytotoxic potential of MPEO on maize (Zea mays L.). The pot experiments assessed the effect of varying doses of MPEO or maltodextrin, a carrier of microcapsules, mixed with the growth substrates, on maize\u2019s emergence and early growth. The morphological analyses were supported by the measurements of total phenolics in the second leaf and roots. The MPEO revealed phytotoxic effects on maize in all of the growth substrates already at a low dose (36.0 g m\u22122), displayed by the delays of maize emergence, reduced growth, and biomass accumulation. Maltodextrin also caused significant reductions in biomass of maize roots. In conclusion, maize is susceptible to substrate-applied MPEO, the type of substrate and the cultivar of maize, can modify this effect to a limited extent.

Analyses were performed after 0, 3, 6, and 9 months of storage in floor warehouses and silos. We monitored microbial changes based on the quantitative determination of microorganisms using a plate dilution method and qualitative determination of microorganisms, where we identified a particular species of bacteria using the MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Based on the quantitative determination of microorganisms, we found that the total plate counts of microorganisms was higher in malts than in barley grains. The storage period had the greatest impact on the number of coliform bacteria, which gradually increased with the growing months in storage. The number of lactic acid bacteria in barley grains with the growing months in storage and malt produced from them decreased slightly, and the content of the sporulating bacteria in all the samples fluctuated slightly. Differences in the numbers of observed microorganisms were negligible during storage between floor warehouses and silos. In the samples of barleys, the most commonly identified species were Pantoea agglomerans, which was also present in malt samples but did not belong to the dominant species. A diverse species representation appeared in the samples, whereas predominating species belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the consistency of response of two soybean cultivars to three different rates of mineral N fertilization and two seed inoculation treatments with B. japonicum in field conditions over four years regardless of previous B. japonicum presence in the soil. A highly-diversified-over-years rainfall and temperature in the growing season do not allow for a definite statement of the differences resulting from seed inoculation and mineral N fertilization applied separately or jointly in soybean. A high sensitivity of the nodulation process to rainfall deficits was noted, which resulted in a decreased amount of B. japonicum DNA measured in qPCR and dry matter of nodules. \u2018Annushka\u2019 demonstrated a higher yield of seeds and protein, higher plants and the 1st pod setting. \u2018Aldana\u2019, due to a significant decrease in plant density, produced a higher number of pods, seeds per pod and the 1000 seed weight per plant. Both cultivars responded with an increase in the seed yield after seed inoculation with HiStick, also with an application of 30 and 60 kg N, as well as with Nitragina with 60 kg N.

Root hairs and root surface were colonized by a stable GFP (green fluorescent protein) transformant of the fungus. Hyphal penetration in root cells was also observed. Spores of P. chlamydosporia 123, significantly increase root and leaf length and weight in banana plantlets (Musa acuminata cv. \u2018Dwarf Cavendish\u2019) in growth chamber experiments 30 days post-inoculation. In greenhouse 8-L pot experiments, P. chlamydosporia 123 spore inoculation significantly increases root, corm and leaf length, and leaf weight in banana plants (75 days post-inoculation). Spore inoculation of P. chlamydosporia strains from diverse origin (Pc21, Pc123, Pc399, and Pccat), significantly increase root, corm and leaf length and weight in banana plantlets. Pc21 from Italy was the best colonizer of banana roots. Consequently, this strain significantly increases banana root and leaf length most. Root colonization by P. chlamydosporia was also detected using cultural techniques and qPCR.

With global environmental conditions changing, potato clones resistant to variable water supply are needed and identifying them is a major task. Many indices assessing potato tolerance to water deficit have been proposed, albeit none of them takes into account the severity of the stress or the sensitivity of the developmental stage during which the stress occurs. As a result, data obtained on genotypes in one location or season are normally not useful in another location or in a different season. We have developed an index evaluating yield response of potato to water deficit based on the soil tension the genotype was subjected to for the duration of the stress modified by the development stage of the genotype. The sum of the daily values was combined in a stress severity index (SSI). In total thirteen genotypes differing in duration and sensitivity to drought were subjected to four levels of deficit irrigation on two soil types at different development stages over two years. Early drought (early tuber filling) reduced yields up to 95% whereas late drought (late tuber bulking) reduced yields significantly less. SSI depended on the genotypic phenological development and on the soil tension values and ranges between 25 and 3500. The index differentiated genotypic responses well across treatments and soil types, even with these relatively advanced development stages, up to a value of 1000. Beyond 1000, yields were generally reduced by more than 60% and a differentiation between genotypes was not possible anymore. SSI constitutes a method that renders site, location, year, season, and soil type effects comparable for responses of potato clones to soil water deficit. Combining this measure of stress severity with other proposed indices may improve upon their current weaknesses in finding or identifying the underlying traits of drought tolerance in potato.

Anthocyanin mutants, like the pink-fruited cultivar \u2018Pink Lemonade\u2019, are valuable resources for investigating anthocyanin biosynthesis in blueberries. In this study, we examined expression of flavonoid pathway genes during fruit development in wild-type, blue-fruited blueberries using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression was also compared between wild-type and the pink-fruited \u2018Pink Lemonade\u2019. This revealed significantly lower expression in \u2018Pink Lemonade\u2019 than in wild-type of nearly all the structural genes examined suggesting that a transcriptional regulator of the pathway was affected. Hence, we compared expression of three known regulatory genes and found that the gene encoding the transcription factor MYB1 was expressed at a significantly lower level in \u2018Pink Lemonade\u2019 than in the wild-type. To validate the capacity of this MYB1 to regulate the transcription of anthocyanin genes in blueberries, a transient expression assay was conducted. Results indicated MYB1 overexpression enhanced anthocyanin production. Comparative sequence analysis between wild-type and mutant MYB1 variants found differences in highly conserved features suggesting a mechanistic explanation for the mutant phenotype. Collectively, the results presented here contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in Vaccinium.

Its rusticity and nutritious value is calling back attention for its reintroduction into Mediterranean rain-fed farming systems. We studied the adaptation of a range of breeding lines in multi-environment field testing in Spain and Egypt, showing wide variation for grain yield. Broomrape (Orobanche crenata) infection appeared as the major limiting factor in both countries. Level of broomrape infection was highly influenced by environmental conditions, being favored by moderate temperatures at crop flowering and rain and humidity after flowering. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis was applied to understand the interaction between genotype (G) and environment (E) on grain yield and on broomrape infection. AMMI analyses revealed significant G and E effects as well as G*E interaction with respect to both traits. The AMMI analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that both, yield and broomrape infection were dominated by the environment main effect. AMMI1 biplot for grain yield revealed Ls10 and Ls11 as the accession with highest yields, closely followed by Ls16, Ls18 and Ls19. However, these accessions showed also lower stability, being particularly adapted to Delta Nile conditions. On the contrary, accessions Ls12 and Ls14 were more adapted to rain fed Spanish conditions. Accessions Ls7, Ls1 and Ls3 were the most stable over environments for grain yield. View Full-Text", "The practical use of molecular markers is facilitated by cost-effective detection techniques. In this work, wheat insertion site-based polymorphisms (ISBP) markers were set up for genotyping using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM). Polymorphic HRM-ISBP assays were developed for wheat chromosomes 4A and 3B and used for wheat variability assessment. The marker sequences were mapped against the wheat genome reference sequence, targeting interesting genes. Those genes were located within or in proximity to previously described quantitative trait loci (QTL) or meta-quantitative trait loci (MQTL) for drought and heat stress tolerance, and also yield and yield related traits. Eighteen of the markers used tagged drought related genes and, interestingly, eight of the genes were differentially expressed under different abiotic stress conditions. These results confirmed HRM as a cost-effective and efficient tool for wheat breeding programs. View Full-Text", "Snake melon (Cucumis melo subsp. melo L. var. flexuosus (L.) Naudin) is an ancient and traditional crop in the Mediterranean region. Nevertheless, there has been poor interest in assessing snake melon germplasm where its genetic resources have not been surveyed before despite their potential in adaptation to environmental changes. In this study, we assess the genetic diversity of snake melon landraces collected from different Lebanese regions at both morphological and molecular levels. Morphological characterization using a set of 18 descriptors revealed an important phenotypic variability among the landraces studied. Principle component analysis indicated that fruit hair and its consistency, fruit size, and skin color pattern were good criteria for discriminating among landraces. Based on the scatter plot diagram, landraces of snake melon formed five different groups with one being defined as typical var. flexuosus. Ten simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used for the molecular characterization. Fifty-six different alleles were detected, with an average of 5.6 alleles per locus. Polymorphism information content of SSR markers ranged from 0.06 to 0.84 (average 0.38). Cluster analysis based on molecular markers showed high genetic diversity and divided the landraces into five distinct genetic groups, confirming thereby the morphological variability. Findings of this study indicate a significant diversity for the Lebanese snake melon germplasm that must be further conserved and considered in improvement programs of this ancient crop.

However, just like in other woody species, apricot breeding is highly time and space demanding, and this is particularly true for PPV resistance phenotyping. Therefore, marker-assisted selection (MAS) may be very helpful to speed up breeding programs. Tightly linked ParPMC1 and ParPMC2, meprin and TRAF-C homology (MATH)-domain-containing genes have been proposed as host susceptibility genes required for PPV infection. Contribution of additional genes to PPV resistance cannot be discarded, but all available studies undoubtedly show a strong correlation between ParPMC2-resistant alleles (ParPMC2res) and PPV resistance. The ParPMC2res allele was shown to carry a 5-bp deletion (ParPMC2-del) within the second exon that has been characterized as a molecular marker suitable for MAS (PMC2). Based on this finding, we propose here a method for PPV resistance selection in apricot by combining high-throughput DNA extraction of 384 samples in 2 working days and the allele-specific genotyping of PMC2 on agarose gel. Moreover, the PMC2 genotype has been determined by PCR or by using whole-genome sequences (WGS) in 175 apricot accessions. These results were complemented with phenotypic and/or genotypic data available in the literature to reach a total of 325 apricot accessions. As a whole, we conclude that this is a time-efficient, cost-effective and straightforward method for PPV resistance screening that can be highly useful for apricot breeding programs.

Although changes in plant community composition imply changes in soil function, this relationship is not well understood. We investigated the relative importance of environmental (climatic, management and soil) variables and plant functional diversity (PFT composition and interactions) on soil activity and fertility along a climatic gradient. We collected samples of soil and PFT biomass (grasses, legumes, and non-legume forbs) in six extensively managed grasslands along a climatic gradient in the Northern Iberian Peninsula. Variation Partitioning Analysis showed that abiotic and management variables explained most of the global variability (96.5%) in soil activity and fertility; soil moisture and grazer type being the best predictors. PFT diversity accounted for 27% of the total variability, mostly in interaction with environmental factors. Diversity-Interaction models applied on each response variable revealed that PFT-evenness and pairwise interactions affected particularly the nitrogen cycle, enhancing microbial biomass nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, total nitrogen, urease, phosphatase, and nitrification potential. Thus, soil activity and fertility were not only regulated by environmental variables, but also enhanced by PFT diversity. We underline that climate change-induced shifts in vegetation composition can alter greenhouse gas\u2014related soil processes and eventually the feedback of the soil to the atmosphere.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate cotton genotypes for water conservation traits, i.e., high FTSW (Fraction of Transpirable Soil Water) threshold for transpiration. Plants utilize water slowly by declining transpiration at high FTSW and conserving soil water, which can be used by the plant later in the growing season to improve yield. Fifteen cotton varieties were selected based on their differences in transpiration response to elevated vapor pressure deficit (VPD) to study drought responses. Two pot experiments were carried out in the greenhouse to determine the FTSW threshold for the transpiration rate as the soil dried. A significant variation (p < 0.01) in the FTSW threshold values for transpiration decline was observed, ranging from 0.35 to 0.60 among cotton cultivars. Genotypes with high FTSW thresholds also displayed low transpiration under well-watered conditions. Further studies with four selected genotype contrasts in FTSW threshold values for transpiration showed differences (p < 0.05 to 0.001) in gas exchange parameters and water potentials. This study demonstrated that there are alternate traits among the cotton genotypes for enhancing soil water conservation to improve yield under water-limited conditions.

In order to overcome the productivity barrier the Translational Pigeonpea Genomics Consortium (TPGC) was established, representing research institutes from six different states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh) of India. To enhance pigeonpea productivity and production the team has been engaged in deploying modern genomics approaches in breeding and popularizing modern varieties in farmers\u2019 fields. For instance, new genetic stock has been developed for trait mapping and molecular breeding initiated for enhancing resistance to fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic disease in 11 mega varieties of pigeonpea. In parallel, genomic segments associated with cleistogamous flower, shriveled seed, pods per plant, seeds per pod, 100 seed weight, and seed protein content have been identified. Furthermore, 100 improved lines were evaluated for yield and desirable traits in multi-location trials in different states. Furthermore, a total of 303 farmers\u2019 participatory varietal selection (FPVS) trials have been conducted in 129 villages from 15 districts of six states with 16 released varieties/hybrids. Additionally, one line (GRG 152 or Bheema) from multi-location trials has been identified by the All India Coordinated Research Project on Pigeonpea (AICRP-Pigeonpea) and released for cultivation by the Central Variety Release Committee (CVRC). In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups through TPGC is accelerating genetics gains in breeding plots and is expected to deliver them to pigeonpea farmers to enhance their income and improve livelihood.

However, the evolutionary outcomes of recurrent herbicide selection at low rates are far less understood. In this study of a herbicide-susceptible population of Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum, we assessed the potential for low glufosinate rates to select for reduced susceptibility to the herbicide, and cross-resistance to herbicides with other modes of action. Reduced susceptibility to glufosinate was detected in progeny in comparison with the parental population following three rounds of selection at low glufosinate rates. Differences were mainly observed at the 0.5X, 0.75X, and 1X rates. Comparing the parental susceptible population and progeny from the second and third selection cycle, the percentage of surviving plants increased to values of LD50 (1.31 and 1.16, respectively) and LD90 (1.36 and 1.26, respectively). When treated with three alternative herbicides (glyphosate, paraquat, and sethoxydim), no plants of either the parental or successive progeny populations survived treatment with 0.75X or higher rates of these herbicides. The results of this study provide clear evidence that reduced susceptibility to glufosinate can evolve in weed populations following repeated applications of glufosinate at low herbicide rates. However, the magnitude of increases in resistance levels over three generations of recurrent low-rate glufosinate selection observed is relatively low compared with higher levels of resistance observed in response to low-rate selection with other herbicides (three fold and more).

The symbiotic compatibility of selected isolates was investigated using two agronomically important plants, red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.). A high genetic diversity of analysed strains was shown using the Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) method. Most of the strains showed a high similarity to R. leguminosarum in the 16S rRNA sequence. Two strains were identified as Agrobacterium spp. There was a strong positive correlation between fresh clover weight and the number of root nodules and a statistically significant increase in the number of the root nodules in selected strains compared to the negative control. Phenotypic tests and BIOLOG analysis showed the ability of the analysed strains to grow in different experimental conditions (pH = 6\u201310, 0.5\u20133% NaCl, different carbon and nitrogen sources), which makes them suitable for application as an agronomically important factor.

Few studies have assessed locally-available substrates in hydrologically variable floodplain environments. We investigated the effects of green and farmyard manures on rice yields, and total soil C and N in the Kilombero floodplain, Tanzania. At both the fringe and the middle positions, five treatments were applied in 2016 and 2017, comprising (1) non-amended control, (2) farmyard manure, (3) pre-rice legumes, (4) post-rice legumes and (5) a combination of green and farmyard manures. Residual treatment effects were assessed in 2018 when rice plots were uniformly non-amended. Depending on the year and the position, organic amendments increased rice grain yields by 0.7\u20133.1 Mg ha\u20131 above the non-amended control. Sole green and farmyard manure applications had similar effects on grain yield, while a combination of green and farmyard manure led to a significant increase in grain yield above both the control and sole applications of organic amendments in both years. The contribution from biological N2 fixation by legumes ranged from 4 to 61 kg N ha\u20131. Despite partial N balances being mostly negative, we observed positive residual effects on the yield of the non-amended rice in the third year. Such effects reached up to 4 Mg ha\u22121 and were largest with post-rice legumes, sole or combined with farmyard manure. Irrespective of the position in the floodplain, manures significantly increased soil C and N contents after two years, hence enhancing soil fertility and resulting in increased rice grain yields. Comparable benefits may be obtained along the hydrological gradients of other large river floodplains of the region and beyond.

Weedy rice is characterized by a high biological diversity that permits different populations to be identified on the basis of their morphological and physiological traits. This variability contributes to its success in different environments and allows different abiotic stresses, which are intensified by climate change, to be faced. Taller plants, enhanced tillering, seed shattering and the presence of red pericarp, variable hull coloration and awn morphology, linked to a deeper seed dormancy, are some of the traits that help weedy rice to spread in changing environments. The higher phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability of weedy rice make it more able to cope with temperature variations, intermittent water availability, soil salinity, drought conditions and increased CO2 concentrations than cultivated rice. As these abiotic stresses will become more frequent in the future, weedy rice competitiveness may be higher, with a spread of infestations. Thus, the control of weedy rice should be based on an integration of different preventive and agronomic techniques, a sensible use of herbicides and the use of suitable rice varieties.

In this study, commercial hybrids were tested for resistance to Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, and Fusarium verticillioides (kernel and silk channel), as well as their toxin response. One third of the hybrids tested showed a similar resistance or susceptibility to the three pathogens and their toxin response, but there is no proof for their genetic background being the same or different. The performance of the remaining hybrids was highly variable and supports the idea of different genetic regulation. The mean ear rot severity of the kernel resistance was doubled compared with the silk channel resistance data. The ear rot and toxin tests displayed significant positive correlations, verifying the decisive role of resistance in toxin regulation. Several hybrids, termed toxigenic hybrids, showed significant extra toxin production, indicating an additional food safety risk. The toothpick method gave more reliable results and a better differentiation of genotypes. The resistance to different Fusarium spp. in a specific growing region should be analyzed separately in independent resistance tests. Through this, the food safety risks could be better identified. Susceptible hybrids should not be used for commercial production.

Purple corn protein concentrates (PCPCs) were obtained by alkaline extraction at pH 8.0 and pH 10.0, followed by an isoelectric precipitation process at pH 4.0, pH 5.0 and pH 6.0. Proteins and phenolic content of PCPCs was calculated. PCPC antioxidant properties were determined by the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in vitro method and by the 2,2-azinobis, 3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, (ABTS) in vitro method. Andean purple corn seeds were able to germinate under the germination conditions tested in this study. The higher percentage of germination was of 63.33% at 168 h/25 \u00b0C. The PCPCs protein profile was characterized for the presence of six bands with molecular weights of 14.50 kDa, 20.12 kDa, 25.18 kDa, 41.85 kDa, 59.59 kDa, and 65.87 kDa. Germinated PCPC presented a high TPC content with ranges of 605.71\u20131820.00 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g PCPC dry weight (DW), germinated PCPC/72 h/25 \u00b0C presented a higher value of 1820.00 mg GAE/g PCPC, DW. All germinated PCPCs samples assayed presented strong antioxidant activity when measured by the ABTS and FRAP methods. Germinated PCPC/144 h/35 \u00b0C presented high antioxidant activity by ABTS with 804.35 \u00b5mol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g PCPC DW and germinated PCPC/144 h/30 \u00b0C presented a high value by the FRAP method, 987.83 \u00b5mol TE/g PCPC DW.

The experiments were conducted in the years 2009\u20132012 in Western Poland. Trees were thinned using a chemical agent, ammonium thiosulphate (ATS), at doses of 20 g ATS L\u22121, 30 g ATS L\u22121 and 40 g ATS L\u22121, and by hand, and the results of chemical and hand thinning were compared with those obtained for unthinned trees. The course of weather conditions in winter and during flowering had a significant impact on yield. Chemical thinning is known to be an effective method to regulate fruiting of pome trees, but it can also be successful if applied to cherry trees, as reflected by the alternate bearing index, which was the lowest after applying ATS at a dose of 40 g. ATS treatment improved fruit quality in full crop years. Thinning resulted in, among other things, larger and darker fruit and higher content of total soluble solids and titratable acidity. Treatment with 40 g ATS L\u22121 significantly stimulated the vegetative growth of trees.

In recent years, the susceptibility of local wheat cultivars has substantially decreased grain yield and quality. Therefore, local breeding projects must be adjusted toward the improvement of LR and SR disease resistances, including genetic approaches. In this study, a spring wheat segregating population of Pamyati Azieva (PA) \u00d7 Paragon (Par), consisting of 98 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), was analyzed for the resistance to LR and SR at the seedling and adult plant-growth stages. In total, 24 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to rust diseases at the seedling and adult plant stages were identified, including 11 QTLs for LR and 13 QTLs for SR resistances. Fourteen QTLs were in similar locations to QTLs and major genes detected in previous linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies. The remaining 10 QTLs are potentially new genetic factors for LR and SR resistance in wheat. Overall, the QTLs revealed in this study may play an important role in the improvement of wheat resistance to LR and SR per the marker-assisted selection approach.

The study was based on a 100-year stationary field microplot experiment where the soil profiles were collected with preserving the natural soil horizons. The microplot experiment was carried out on eight different soil types: Brunic Arenosol (Dystric I), Rendzic Leptosol, Fluvic Cambisol, Haplic Cambisol (Eutric), Gleyic Phaeozem, Brunic Arenosol (Dystric II), Haplic Cambisol (Eutric II) and Haplic Cambisol (Dystric). These soils are the most common types of agricultural soils in Poland. Relatively significant correlations with the soil quality, physical parameters and the glomalin-related soil proteins have been found. The study determined the total GRSP (T-GRSP) and easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) levels in soils as well as the soil physical quality index and soil\u2019s microbial biodiversity. The GRSP depended on the type of soil and correlated with S-Index and also was responsible for the unique chemical and physical properties of soils. Soils characterized by the highest T-GRSP content belonged to the group of very good and good soil physical quality characterized also by high biological activity, for which there were strong correlations with such parameters as dehydrogenase activity (DHA), microbial biomass content (MBC), microbial nitrogen content (MBN) and total bacteria number (B). The highest T-GRSP content and higher microbial diversity were found in Gleyic Phaeozem, Rendzic Leptosol and Fluvic Cambisol. The T-GRSP and EE-GRSP content were additionally correlated with the number of AMF spores. Very poor and poor soil physical quality according to S-Index characterized Brunic Arenosol (Dystric I) and Haplic Cambisol (Dystric). This research indicates that a specific edaphone of soil microorganisms and GRSP content may be of great importance when assessing a soil\u2019s quality and improvements in soil health. The abundance of glomalin-producing fungi significantly affects the quality of the soil. This effect is particularly important for agricultural soils are threatened by ongoing land degradation.

The objective of this study was to identify the climatic factors associated with the variation in soybean productivity under the contrasting eco-geographical conditions of the Krasnodar (KR) and Primorye (PR) territories of Russia. An analysis of 424 soybean varieties from the global collection of the N.I. Vavilov Institute (VIR) at experimental stations in KR and PR in 1987\u20132005 showed that the soybean yields were higher and time to maturity was longer in KR than in PR, while the 1000 seed weight, on average, was irrelevant to the place of cultivation. The agrometeorological regression models of the observations in 1972\u20132017 of varieties accepted as the standards showed that the yield in PR was positively related to the sum of the temperatures above 10 \u00b0C and negatively related to precipitation in October, while in KR it was positively related to the hydrothermal coefficient. The stability of the soybean yield and of the time to maturity were higher in PR than in KR. Under the conditions of increasing temperatures and the absence of reliable trends for precipitation, a lack of moisture becomes a significant disadvantage for soybean in KR, while in PR conditions are improving.

Nevertheless, the fertigation of almond plantations is currently inefficient (50% nitrogen (N) recovery by yields) due to the limited empirical data to support field applications. For precise fertigation in horticulture, we aimed to determine the trees\u2019 actual mineral uptake. We hypothesized that the mineral requirements depend on physiological development and would vary during the growing season as phenology shifts. To investigate this, we tracked the water, N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) mass-balances of almond trees in 1 m3 lysimeters and monitored their physiological performances. By canopy coverage (leaf area index\u2014LAI)) and radial stem growth, we determined that almond trees invest in biomass between April and July (northern hemisphere). Then, for August until November, the almond trees accumulated metabolites and minerals for the succeeding winter dormancy. Annually, almond trees can utilize major N applications (~180 kg h\u22121) in early summer for vegetative growth, extract P (~50 kg h\u22121) by mid-summer for metabolic translocations, and accumulate K (>250 kg h\u22121) in late summer, possibly for osmotic compensations. Converting these realizations for farm conditions requires the further characterization of the mineral availability at the root zone, and the nutritional status of trees, under various field fertigation applications.

Limited information is available on the most suitable testers that allow the selection of yellow endosperm maize inbred lines with good combining ability for resistance to witchweed (Striga hermonthica) and superior agronomic performance in hybrids targeted to areas infested with the parasite. Testcrosses of 30 Striga-resistant yellow endosperm maize inbred lines with three testers having varying levels of resistance to S. hermonthica were evaluated at Abuja and Mokwa in Nigeria under Striga-infested and non-infested conditions in 2018 and 2019. The lines \u00d7 tester interaction was significant for grain yield under Striga infestation, indicating that the performance lines in testcrosses varied with the testers. The respective average general combining ability effect of lines and testers was 1.5 and 32.4 times greater than the corresponding specific combining ability effects under infestation, showing the greater importance of additive gene action controlling the performance of testcrosses under Striga infestation. The different testers exhibited a different capacity to discriminate among the test lines with the susceptible tester being the least effective. Most of the criteria used to determine the best tester favored the selection of the tolerant and resistant testers as promising candidates to identify superior Striga-resistant yellow endosperm inbred lines for the hybridization and development of resistant hybrids. The results of this study demonstrated that testers with a high frequency of desirable alleles were superior to the tester with a low frequency of favorable alleles in hybrid breeding programs for resistance to S. hermonthica.

Despite a progressive water deficit and significant yield loss, the measurements indicated very minor changes in chlorophyll content or canopy cover. This corresponded well to the insignificant differences in spectral reflectance normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values. On the other hand, we identified the significant and rapid response of fast fluorescence kinetics data following the onset of irrigation. Analysis of parameters showed the main effects of drought were associated with changes in the amplitude of the I\u2013P phase of the OJIP transient, indicating changes at the level of photosystem I and beyond. Statistical analyses identified the integrative parameter performance index PItot as the most sensitive parameter, which well-reflects the differences in responses of the genotypes to water deficit. Our results suggest that focusing on photosynthetic functions detected by the rapid chlorophyll fluorescence records can provide more accurate information on the drought stress level, compared to the structural data obtained by absorbance or reflectance measurements.

It infects many plant species and reduces both the productivity and quality of crops. Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an economically important crop. In order to develop a molecular marker that can be used more conveniently in the development of PM-resistant melon using MR-1 melon resources, the previously reported cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was improved with a length polymorphism PCR marker. Two cleaved CAPS markers\u2014BSA12-LI3ECORI and BSA12-LI4HINFI\u2014associated with BPm12.1, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) corresponding to the PM resistance of MR-1, have been reported. In this study, we found that in the BSA12-LI3ECORI CAPS marker specifically, a 41 bp deletion was present in the PCR DNA region of the MR-1 melon genome. A new marker capable of distinguishing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) length polymorphism was produced using insertion-deletion (InDel) information in this region. This PCR-based InDel marker distinguished the genotypes of PM-resistant MR-1, PM-susceptible Top Mark, and their F1 progeny. These results suggest that this InDel marker could be used to develop PM-resistant melon varieties based on MR-1.

Inducing earlier and abundant flowering in crossing nurseries (involving erect genotypes) is a key objective for cassava and was the subject of this study. Five genotypes with contrasting flowering behavior were grown under dark night (DN) and extended photoperiod (EP) conditions for three seasons. EP was achieved with different red light emitting diodes (LEDs) with 625\u2013635 nm wavelength all night long or through night-breaks. EP reduced height and number of days to first branching, particularly in non- or late-flowering genotypes. A minimum of 0.02 \u03bcmol m\u22122 s\u22121 was required to elicit earlier flowering in plants illuminated all night. Early results using five genotypes were validated across 116 genotypes planted in a crossing nursery. EP promoted earlier flowering in erect-plant genotypes but reduced the number of branching events in early flowering genotypes to some extent. 50W LED lamps, fixed at 3 m above ground in a 4.5 m grid, proved to be a practical approach to extend photoperiod in breeding nurseries. Night breaks also proved effective, thus opening the possibility of using solar panels where electricity is not available.

Safflower is mainly cultivated in Asia for its use as floret. In Germany, an economically attractive cultivation for floret use would require a mechanization of harvest. In order to develop a mechanical harvesting system, field experiments were conducted at the experimental station Ihinger Hof of the University Hohenheim in 2017 and 2018. Safflower was harvested with a combine harvester to obtain the florets. Two safflower (i) cultivars were harvested with (ii) three threshing parameter settings on (iii) five harvest dates to evaluate threshed floret yield, dry matter and carthamidin content, and carthamidin yield. Results showed that the maximum threshed floret yield was achieved at the latest harvest date (784.78\u20131141.76 kg ha\u22121), while the highest carthamidin contents were observed depending on cultivar on the first two harvest dates (0.53\u20133.14%). The decisive and resulting amount of carthamidin yield reached its maximum with the Chinese cultivar and the threshing parameter setting P3 between the fourth and fifth harvest date in 2018 (19.05\u201319.36 kg ha\u22121). Highest dry matter contents were achieved at the last harvest date (62.67\u201377.77%). Individual capitula weight and carthamidin content decreased with later harvest dates. Further investigations should clarify whether the individual capitula weight and carthamidin content correlate with each other or are independent of the date of harvest. This could be a decisive criterion for the selection of cultivars for harvesting florets with a combine harvester. Reduced costs of machine harvesting compared to hand harvesting will make the cultivation of safflower for the food coloring industry in Germany more attractive in the future.

This paper analyzes factors underpinning the adoption of improved groundnut varieties among farmers to pave the way for upscaling quality seed used for increased production and commodity business in farming communities. A four-stage stratified sampling was used to collect data from 300 groundnut farmers in seven agro-ecological zones through individual interviews. Secondary data were collected from the literature and the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute at Naliendele centre (TARI\u2013Naliendele). Descriptive statistics and Probit regression model were used for data analysis. The empirical results showed that Johari 1985, Pendo 1998, Naliendele 2009, Mnanje 2009, Mangaka 2009 and Nachi 2015, are the main six improved groundnut varieties used by farmers, with Pendo 1998 having the highest adoption rate (17.1%). In the grain market, four varieties, namely Pendo 1998, Mnanje 2009, Nachi 2015 and Johari 1985, were observed to be highly preferred by grain off-takers. Furthermore, among the adopted improved varieties, Nachi 2015, is observed to be the most consistent high yielding variety, ranging from 1100 kg/ha to 1500 kg/ha in all agro-ecological zones. A farmer\u2019s decision to adopt new varieties is affected by age and gender, farmer group membership, availability of improved seed and seed cost. Overall, male farmers are more likely to adopt improved varieties of groundnut than female farmers. The implications of these findings are also discussed, in particular in the area of policy support.

This study surveyed the field occurrence of potato tuber moth in various sites in South Korea and used the results to validate the CLIMEX model, which spatiotemporally evaluated the potential distribution of potato tuber moths in response to climate change. The potato tuber moths were predicted to appear throughout the country, consistent with the results obtained for potato tuber moths in 96% of the field survey area. In addition, the climatic suitability of potato tuber moths will remain high due to climate change, suggesting a high risk for damage to seasonal potato production from seeding to harvesting. This spatiotemporal assessment of potato tuber moth distribution is expected to aid in establishing control strategies optimized based on time and place.

Common bean was cultivated according to organic or conventional farming practices during spring-summer in two successive years with crop and treatment during the preceding winter as either: (a) organic broccoli, (b) conventional broccoli, (c) organic faba bean used as green manure, or (d) fallow. Common bean was either inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 or non-inoculated, while faba bean was inoculated or non-inoculated with Rhizobium laguerreae VFLE1. Inoculating faba bean with rhizobia enhanced dry biomass production and biological N-fixing ability in both experimental years. Furthermore, organic farming did not restrict the yield of broccoli compared to conventional practices during the first year, while the reverse was the case in the second year, due to reduced soil N availability. Furthermore, green manure enhanced the fresh pod yield in the following organic crop of common bean in both years. The lowest yield was recorded in organically grown common bean when the preceding winter crop was organically grown broccoli in both years. Rhizobia inoculation of the common bean during the first year slightly increased atmospheric N fixation by common bean.

To study the impact of different features expressions and classification methods on cultivar identification, the performance of the feature expressions and classification algorithms affecting the accuracy of cultivar identification was evaluated by image processing techniques. A total of 448 samples of seeds from seven cultivars of sweet corn, namely, Orlando, Beiyasi, Jingketian 183, Jingtian 218, Suitian 1, CT76 and Lilixiangtian, were evaluated. The color, shape and texture features of the seeds were extracted from the images, and the class separability criterion was adopted to evaluate the separability of the features of the embryo side, nonembryo side and both of them combined. The results indicate that the class separability based on the features of the embryo side was higher than that based on the nonembryo side and both of them combined. Based on the embryo-side optical feature data, dimensionality reduction was conducted by two feature selection methods (stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and genetic algorithm (GA)) and two feature extraction methods (principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)). Performance evaluation of the feature reductions was conducted by constructing k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), na\u00efve Bayes (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Compared to the PCA and KPCA algorithms, the SDA and GA algorithms were more conducive to the cultivar classification of sweet corn seeds; the critical features selected specifically by the SDA, K-NN, NB, LDA and SVM classifiers achieved the best classification accuracies (81.43%, 82.86%, 90%, and 87.14%, respectively). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the approach for optical feature selection had a more significant effect on the identification of sweet corn seed cultivars than did the classifiers. Therefore, based on the optical images of the embryo side and the key features obtained by the feature selection method, a classification model was constructed for the accurate and nondestructive classification of different sweet corn seed cultivars.
